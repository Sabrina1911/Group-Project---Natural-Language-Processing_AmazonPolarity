"Valient effort, low budget

I really enjoyed this worthy effort to get Lovecraft right. There were some budget/technical issues. For instance, the stop-motion Cthulu wasn't very satisfying, even given the low budget. In fact, the design of the hideous statues and such wasn't very satisfying in general. But the weird angular design of buildings in the dreams and finally the island were very well done, both creepy and ""modern"". The actors did a great job, and the script was wonderfully faithful to the source material. If you love the story and can put up with a pretty heinous Cthulu special effect, this is well worth getting.",1
"O my gosh dont bother

Smith, Dick. Babe: The Galliant Pig. Knopf Paperback.118 pages.Knopf's Babe The Galliant Pig is an inspiring, and heart-warming story about a pig that goes to the Hoggot farm. At this farm Mrs. Hogget is having dreams of a big fat pig that she can make into bacon. The pig's destiny is breakfast until Mr. Hoggot reveals a talent Babe has. He is a sheepherder. Babe is the best sheep dog Mr. Hoggot has ever hade. Shortly after finding babe's talent he is entered in a sheep-dog championship. The audience is confused to see this sheep-pig. Will this galliant pig win the tournament? Babe The Galliant Pig is the most pointless story I have ever read. There is hardly any plot, and the ending was enormously cheesy. I don't recommend this book to anyone.",0
"Lapses in Historical Accuracy

I also agree that this book is one-sided for Wood had created serious lapses in historical accuracy. It is simply incorrect to call Alexander or his Macedonian army ""Greek"", when the ancient Greek and Roman historians made a clear distinction between the Greek and Macedonian nations. Alexander was known as Macedonian and had never been called ""Greek"" in any ancient text, and Wood should have represented him for what he was. Instead he left an inaccurate portrait of the famous conqueror ascribing him a false ethnicity and identity for which he was also sharply criticized by Archaeology in 1998.",0

"Works great. Would recommend.

I purchased three of these to keep my entertainment cabinet with my gaming consoles and HD TV. I was going to purchase three insert fans that would require three holes drilled in the side of my cabinet and would have a temperature control to cut on and off..but at over 3x the price of doing the same thing with these I chose to use this product. I have a usb hub plugged into my HD TV and have two of these fans setup to cool it and have the third plugged into my PS since. By doing this the fans only turn on when my TV or PS3 is turned on...works great and really keeps things cool considering my cabinet is not much bigger than my TV and air ventilation is not that great.If I need any more fans I will be sure and purchase these again.",1

"Way cheaper than vet

My Siberian Husky was scrapping her bum across the ground in a comical looking fashion. As amusing as it was I knew something was wrong. I could have gone to the vet and paid $300 for a diagnosis and treatment.Instead I did some research online and quickly narrowed down what it could be. I found small white grains in her stool the next day, which settled the matter.I spend $16 instead of $300, but I couldn't have done it without these pills. I won't hesitate to use this product again; I highly recommend it.",1
"Beach Reading without shame!

The fifth in the Mary Russell series - out of sequence in the time line of the books, but it's a necessary `prequel' for the sixth book. As some of the other reviewers stated, it takes a long time for the plot to reveal exactly what Holmes and Russell are looking for on this journey. However, as it's a `prequel' to book six, the development of how Holmes and Russell interact with their Arab guides is necessary - and (prequel or no) I thought, interesting. It's a great series - the books are generally a quick read, and usually touch on some topic in enough detail that your interest is sparked into finding a little more about what you're reading about.",1

"Good for audio books, radio plays

One of the other reviewers had noted that this player will start back up right where you stopped it. So I bought it, since other players will back up to the beginning of the track, which is useless for an audio book, unless you enjoy hearing the beginning of a chapter again. Instructions are vague, only 3 buttons to work with. So you'll have to experiment to learn it.1. Hit the play/pause/stop (pps) button TWICE to start.2. Hold the pps button for 3 seconds to stop.3. Hold the volume/skip track buttons to change volume.4. Hit the buttons to skip tracks.I wish it had a display, that's why only 4 stars. No EQ, so I wouldn't recommend for audiophiles. But great for audio books.Oh, Coby also includes a CD rom for the driver, so you can use this with Windows 98.",1
"The best expose' of class in America I've ever read.

I read this book for the first time over 20 years ago. It not only described an aspect of America I long suspected, but described in enlightened detail what was easily observable. Lewis Lapham's writing style is is excellent. Funny, high-brow and piercing.growing up in a privileged world few would ever see let alone experience, Mr. Lapham skewers myths and exposes skeletons in the closets of the jet set. He also does an excellent job of explaining and describing the overlap of politics and the very very rich; the arena of influence where money and politics are exposed as the ""wizard behind the curtain"" of so much that happens in American society. An excellent book. Just beginning to read it for a third time.",1
"Good reading

The book provides a very readable overview of the eath's evolution. I stress overview since it is not intended to be a petrological or mineralogical treatise, but rather a view from a distance. I found it very informative for me despite having a fair degree of understanding from the outset. It could be an excellent book for folks with some knowledge, but little vision of what our earth has gone through and how it made the trip.",1

"Amazon mixer review

I love this mixer. It can handle heavy cookie doughs and looks beautiful on my kitchen counter. The only fault I find with it is the speeds are to the back of the mixer not the front and it is a little inconvenient.

"Unreliable operation

When this product was first received, it was noted that the connections on top were too close together for easy connection. The high amperage (200) needs a substantial connection and it it difficult to do so with this configuration. I would have sent it back, except all the competitive units look similar. I finally designed a connection which would be reliable and not stress the connection points. The item was used for about 30 days with loads up to about 150 amps and then failed when the microwave oven was turned on. (This had been used many times before.) At that time the Inverter drew about 120 amps through this unit. I had the device for several months at that time, so it was too late to return it to the vendor and it was impossible to find the route to the manufacturer to get anything done that way. The coil appears OK, the thing makes the normal snap sound when it operates, but the contacts do not make up.",0
"A simple introduction to Clinical Hypnosis

This was the first book I've read on hypnosis. I found it to be very informative as I had not heard of the new contemperary methods of induction. The book is written well and there are a lot of helpful references to relevent work. I liked this book as it was tied together professionally and wasn't just a collection of trance-scripts.Since I've read this book I have sucessfully hypnotized 3 of 4 attempts. The only thing missing was a pointer to a book that one could use for further self-learing about hypnosis.",1
"Very Cool Doll!

I absolutely love the InuYasha doll! My mom wishes they had dolls like him back in the 60's when she was young. Authentically detailed and fully articulated, he's a must, in my opinion, for any InuYasha fan or doll collector. Too bad the other characters aren't available like this. He really deserves to be standing next to a 1/6 scale Kagome, at least, on display. Anyway, he is nice. Great product!",1
"Feeds a lot of birds simultaneously

I've used this feeder for about 8 or 9 years and it's great because its design partitions the seed into three levels automatically when you fill it from the top. The result is that all 12 feeding stations continue to have seed as the seeds are consumed. Most other feeders begin to deplete the uppper level ports, then the middle ones, and finally only the bottom ports have seed for the birds. With this feeder, each of the three levels individually are emptied out as the birds feed. Plus, holding 8 pounds of seed reduces the number of times it must be filled. There is no down side to this feeder, though one must remember it's heavy when full so hang it securely.",1
"Why bother with this?

Tom Postilio has got a nice voice, but he apes Sinatra so much, it's barely worth listening to him. Go and dig out one of Frank's original albums rather than spend your time listening to a soundalike. Postilio also doesn't have as much rhythm as Sinatra (or Bobby Darin), so the uptempo songs kind of fall flat. I would pass on this disc.",0
"Beyond a flat wall

This is a fascinating book that brings to life the evidence that is not only clear but fairly undeniable. One only has to look at the prophecy in Ezekial 38 and 39 to see that God certainly uses the ""weather"" to shake things up and put an end to anti-semitic/anti-Israeli behavior. It is very easy for a third or fourth party to say to someone 'give your land up to your certain enemy', especially when the third party has no vested interest. The blessed hope in the Faith and in this book is that one doesn't have to be a certain type of scholar to comprehend basic truth. They must simply look beyond a flat wall and see a vision of detailed structure. This book makes that very easy to accomplish.",1

"a theory why Clay fans did not buy this book....

Clay fans historically do not spend money on stories about Clay fans. We can get that for free. To imply that fans were instructed not to buy this is specious - how have other books about Clay sold? Surely the author did not believe this book was another Learning To Sing?Clay fans can also get more information than they need about Clay right on the internet. So again, why buy a book?I did read a bit of the book. Found no reason to buy it.The author evidently thought this book was a slam-dunk for sales to Clay fans, and there is no data to support this. None of the other books written about Clay have done very well - because this is the internet age. We can easily find anything that may be in a book, on our own. This is a vanity publication, with vanity publication sales. And Clay has never endorsed any other book about him; why should he do so now?",0

"just plain cheesy

I got this book at a book swap and later saw that the first 75 pages were missing. I read it anyway and found that I missed nothing at all. The writing is very amateurish with the characters doing lots of cheesy self-reflection. The end is nothing but LDS (mormon) propaganda. The main character is torn between her LDS standards and the man she loves. Lo and behold he turns to the mormon faith and all is well. Puh-leeze! This might be an okay read for a teenager, but for an adult it's pathetic and laughable.",0

"If at first it doesn't work, try again later.

The first times my daughter and I tried this book, she said she hated it. Getting her to lesson 50 was a lot of work, so I put the book down for a few months. When we picked it up again it was so easy. I had her go quickly though three lessons a day until we got back to lesson 50, now we do one lesson a day. I think its a breeze because I found a reward she loves. Every day after her lesson I read a chapter of Patrica Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles (Princesses, dragons, magic, what more could a little girl want). Now she begs for her lesson everyday, and can read almost word she sees. Her brothes run to watch her read when she gets to the story part. I will start my four year old on this book as soon as I find something that will motivate him.",1
"A well-written and timely (even now) expose of Net hype

Even though Silicon Snake Oil is a few years old (ancient by high tech standards) the words of wisdom ring true today. In fact, little has changed really. The hype continues, the promises made, the diappointments legion. I have found little on the Net that compares favorably to real life. Communications, knowledge, realtionships all happen better in the real world than they do online. Only those who have been online so long that there brains have turned to mush would argue with this. The Internet creates more problems than it solves and lowers the quality of life for all those who take part in it. Internet?? Internot!!!!",1

"Botched

Make no mistake, I love EXPRESSO BONGO, and the film itself would normally merit five stars; for style and sensibility, it was ahead of the curve for 1959. Watching this version of it, however, gives the false impression that this is just another teen idol film, due primarily to the several excised musical interludes. Of course, my own discovery of the missing Harvey numbers was upsetting, but by far the biggest letdown was the absence of Meier Tzelniker's peculiar performance of a charming number called ""Nausea,"" the strangest moment in the film and biggest disappointment of this edition. Kino is generally one of the few labels I would buy from sight unseen, but this gives me cause for concern...",0
"So disappointed

Was so disappointed in this book - for the first time in my life, the movie is a thousand times better. The writing was amature and at times, uninteresting, and failed to get into the grit and the heart of what happened.

I shopped around and this looked like a decent looking hub that met my needs (powered, 7 port). I needed to plugin 2 external drives, mouse, scanner, 2 ipods and sometimes my cell phone or camera.

Speed wasn't so bad, but after a while, VMWare complained the drive wasn't available. Sure enough, it wasn't mounted anymore. After putting up with this for a few months, not being sure what was at fault, the hub quit altogether.

"Won't Please Everyone- but a good read

Overall, this is a pretty good book. Definitely good for some laughs and for making one aggravated at the hypocrisy of many of those profiled. Most Democrats and liberal leaning folks will find fault with Goldberg's choices for his list, but I think he reasons each one out fairly well. As he states in his prologue, any type of ""list"" is subjective and no one is ever going to agree 100% with the author's choices. No doubt, Goldberg leans right, but he is fairly middle of the road politically. Conservatives are not left unscathed and many of Goldberg's choices are people I don't necessarily associate with any political philosophy other than self aggrandizement and greed at others' expense. Overall a good book, an entertaining read which makes some good points- but don't expect to agree totally with the author regardless of your political persuasion.",1

The only frightening parts of this wreck are the dreadful script, the haggard plot (people blast a bunch of zombies while trying to shut down a supercomputer in an underground lab), and weak acting by equally weak actors. Milla Jovovich is a far cry from Angelina Jolie as a respectable female action hero, no matter how hard the media tries to incite a rivalry between them. If you were foolish enough to actually pay money to watch this, then immediately go home and cleanse your soul with the superior ""Tomb Raider."" Enough said.",0
"Useless Drivel!

As an avid writer and homeschooling parent, I was very drawn to the title of this book. I believed that it would give me wonderful ideas for projects with which I could motivate my young writers. Instead, the book tells me such things as ""Provide plenty of writing materials."" and ""Write for pleasure yourself."" This is as basic is BREATHING.... Any parent with a third grade education knows that you must have writing materials available. And, of course, a child who sees a parent writing will have more of an interest in doing so. This book DOES NOT provide ideas for motivating young writers. It tells the parents basic, ...facts that they SHOULD already know. I do not recommend this book to anyone.",0
"Happy ending? (slight spoiler)

Charlotte is Sherman McCoy is Charlie Croker - a legend in her own mind, one whose self-constructed fortress of ego is mercilessly demolished, brick by brick, by the author working through his characters, until she crawls from the rubble at the end - to begin building another castle. That, more than race, class, or wealth, is the theme that unites Wolfe's three novels.I must take issue with the reviewers who refer to the novel's happy ending. The close of the book is absolutely chilling - Charlotte, debauched by peer pressure and the jaded, cynical materialism of her Nobel-prizewinning neuroscience professor's theories, doesn't simply lose her soul. She forcibly pushes it down, smothering it under a pillow of noise and stimulation, fannie-shaking cheerleaders and Serbian jugglers. The last words we hear her mother tell her in the book is to look into her soul; Charlotte instead murders it.",1
"A REAL JEWEL OF AN ALBUM FOR SONNY & CHER FANS!!

This Sonny & CHer's Second Album and a improvement on the First Album. There voices blend better together than their first album and this album has a richer sound, too. ""Summertime"" song written By Gershwin gets a rock version here song by S&C is great!! ""Turn Around"" Song by Cher is one her best sung songs. Other pop gems include.. ""TELL HIM""...""I'M Leaving IT UP TO YOU"". Sonnys only solo hit ""Laugh At ME"" is in this album, too. A real jewel of an album for Sonny & CHer Fans",1
"Fresh look at death and what it does to us...

I had read the first chapter of this book here on Amazon.com and then went on to buy it later. I couldn't put it down, and read Susie's story with many tears and much laughter. See, I was a girl in the seventies, so much of the pop culture rang so true. This book is a great read and very moving. I must say, I will not give it to my own mother to read as it would be too much for her (I too easily could have been Susie). I would reccommend it to anyone who would like help dealing with death. As a footnote, I applaud both Susie and her Author for including dogs in our own heavens - for what would heaven be without them?",1
"A Superior Eco-collapse Book.

A classic page turner, where the plot races towards a climax that you can foresee but not predict. If you like Michael Crichton's books, then you will like this book. Be warned that what starts as mankind surviving an fascinating eco-collapse midway through the book turns into a plot about the heroes surviving against the actions of their fellow men. The more interesting eco-collapse theme takes a backseat to the sometimes contrived and highly coincidental interactions between heroes, villains and victims. Still, Dust is worth reading for the scientific ""what-if"" alone.",1
"much better than other non-Russian

I must differ to the previous opinion. Russian of the main singers is bearable enough, especially comparing to the Solti interpretation that sounds really strange. I mean pretty strange conducting, strange choose for the singers, and dreadful, unprofessionally sounding Russian. I can point out just two strong points of that interpretation, which are Giaurov as Gremin and thorough booklet. Otherwise Levine's CD is fine. Probably, Freni is the best Tatiana recorded ever, Shikoff is fabulous (just compare with Burrows!), Levine conducts agreeably, and the record is beautifully scaled. Anyway, I'd prefer entirely Russian interpretation. I am sorry about that.",1

"Half Toasted

I bought this toaster after reading several reviews, finding a reasonable price, and liking the look of it. I was looking to upgrade since my old toaster (a toastmaster) was cranked to the highest setting and needed to go through two toast cycles to lightly brown. I am seriously disappointed with this toaster. I put my english muffin in and only half the muffin toasts, and that half usually ends up burnt. The slots are slanted forward, and it seems that when the muffin is in the toaster, it is the upper portion that over toasts, and the lower portion comes out essentially raw. Though my toastmaster was only 6 years old or so, and had to go through two cycles....it still toasted better then this T-Fal. I bought it several weeks ago and have only used it a handful of times, I am going to try to clean it up good and return it for some other brand.Hope this helps.",0
"Somewhat disappointing

I bought this book hoping to find out new stories about Montreal but would have to agree with the reviewer who said it's mostly recycled and well-known stories. It's a meagre little book with not much in the way of illustrations or photos and each chapter starts with a question, probably meant as a sort of riddle, but then the answer is written right below. I found that irritating.",0

"Terrible! Don't waste your money.

I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with. It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again.",0

"Stuck on a plane and wanted to open the door

This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Normal you can look past problems in the plot but when the movie is so disjointed as this one the rules of the movie has to be fallowed. A man who knows the future and lives in the past will change it just from being there so when one of the rules is you can't change the future that is very hard to pull off, and they don't. So it is really frustrating to watch him change certain things and then act like he can't fix stuff when he gets a chance. I watched this on a flight and by the end I was just frustrated and ready to walk out. The funny thing was that all the people around me felt the same way. The best part of the movie was how fun it was to make fun of it for the last hour of the flight.Just skip this one, it really is not worth it.",0

I definitely recommend this book.",1
"Not very baby friendly

I bought this for my 1 yr old for Christmas to help her learn how to walk. All of the noises and lights and sounds intrigued her. She's never gentle with any of her toys, but what baby is?

"I am bored zzzzzzzzzz....

Am I the only person bored by this album? I like a few tracks, like Chief Inspector, Spaniolated, and Turning Around, but like is the key word here. The album on the whole makes me feel nothing and sounds like this bro and sis meshing a bunch of instruments together to create this atmospheric and indie sounding record. I have no love for this band. Just not feeling it, but to each his own I guess. Now The Arcade Fire, that's a great band!",0
"Not worth it

Well...after only week 2 of this dvd, I am no longer skeptical about JM's promised to kick butt! I can only imagine what the week 4 workout will do to my muscles. This dvd is awesome because it gives you 4 workouts that progress in level of difficulty, and JM always provides modifications for each move. So, basically, there is no excuse for not being able to do each workout. She's also quite entertaining, which helps you work through your sweat. If you want to challenge your body to reach its potential, buy this dvd!",1

"The best earbuds for under $100

If you want to dramatically improve your iPod experience, get rid of the little white earbuds Apple supplies. I've tried four different brands of (under $100) earbuds and the V-Modas are by far the best. Their sound is full and crisp with a deep, rich bass. They are also very light and comfortable to wear. I also think they are the coolest-looking. Sensitivity is about what you'd expect for single-driver units. My only complaint is the ""memory"" of the cables. If you coil the V-Modas up too tightly to put them in a case or your pocket, they can easily turn into a scribbled mess that's hard to straighten out.",1
"Well Worth the Watch

So what if this movie doesn't try to raise the bar with its animation or wow the adults with sophistication?

Go ask Alice is based on a true story, and the author of this book was anonymous. Go ask Alice is not so much of a book, but a diary she writes in about her life. Alice talks about her life and beyond. Her life starts out great, but she gets turned around and starts hanging out with people that do drugs. She gets addicted and starts experimenting with more drugs (LSD) and becomes careless about her life. Flaunting her body off and has been doing immoral behavior. She tries to quit but she is just too addictive to them. She finds her self-growing away from her family as time goes on. Traveling to big cities, she rides with truck drivers to get where she wants to go, and living in run downed apartments. Alice then starts to get her life back on track, but then something happens.

"Not one of my most beloved books

Having seen part of the movie on TV, but never able to catch the whole thing but wanting to, I had high expectations for this book. I eagerly checked it out of the library - only to be disappointed thoroughly. For the most part, this book was extremely boring and at times hard to understand. It took me several readings to finally get the ending, and even then I was puzzled. To put it bluntly, it was just too weird for my tastes. I certainly don't understand how this book could have possibly won a Nobel. And I certainly hated Sethe, who killed her child to spare her a life of slavery and racism. Don't get me wrong: I am not a racist and I believe that slavery was the darkest point in American society and history. But I can't believe a mother would actually kill her own baby due to slavery. Just one of the many things I can't believe or understamd about this book.",0

"little info, lots of preaching

This book is of no practical value. The author preaches and preaches but provides almost no real information. He doesn't even provide information about himself. Refuses to disclose his denomination, makes no mention of how he gains income to feed his family. He just goes on and on with Biblical references and examples from ""Lord of the Rings"" movies to justify whatever vague point he may have. The little real information available amounts to: hang out in a coffee house full of weird people. Make friends with the weird people. Tell them who Jesus is. Tell them to start their own little church. Presto! Lots of people are starting lots of tiny churches all over the world and the commission is fulfilled. Throw in a couple diagrams to prove the argument that this is the ""real"" church for the ""real"" Christians. I guess I could go to his website and buy lots of CDs and sign up for lots of classes.

"Poorly engineered

As long as it was working it was terrific for the price. It's probably still under warranty, but I didn't save the receipt. The upper burr is attached to a flimsy plastic spout through which the beans fall. The torque from the motor will eventually crack this tube rendering the grinder useless and in two pieces. Also, the on off switch is secured inside the case by two thin (1/6th inch) plastic rods which go through the switch and are melted on top. The least stress pulls the switch off the rods making it inaccesible to the outer sliding switch...You then can't turn it off. Save your money and buy a decent grinder.

Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again. Also it is not a hybrid CD like many other artists offer - you can only play this one on a SACD player.

This book, as I understood it, was to have provided new insight to the horrors of The War Between the States as seen through the eyes of children, both North and South. In my humble opinion it is only a poorly researched work based on readily available letters written by Federal soldiers and classic Southern diaries. Small passages from well known sources are intermingled with the authors' personal views that seem to twist the story into glorification of the Federal army and not necessarily what was witnessed by children. There is nothing to really educate or even entertain the average reader of WBTS history. In a nut shell it is old news with a Northern slant.",0

"NEW SOUND FOR G-UNIT

I think its good that G-Unit is bringing in different sounds with the game and young buck. When I first heard the album I wasnt so sure what I thought about it.... you may say I was a little disappointed, but I was expected to be blown away.The album turns out to be a pretty solid album. We all know that his first single ""How We Do"" was hot but there are a lot of others too. Westside Story feat 50 Cent was a good track along with Dreams produced by Kanye and Higher produced by DRE. Put You on the Game which was produced by Timbaland is a good up tempo track. One of my favorites was the Documentary were he gives loves to all the classic rap albums before him. Then there is We Aint feat Em.... just another hot track that you gotta hear.the rest of the album is good but these listed above are the standouts for me. People seem to have mixed feelings about this album but I havent meet anyone who has hated it. If you are G-Unit fan.... go pick this up and give it a good listen.",1
"Fun holiday entertainment

I was told not to expect too much as each one movie in this series is worse than the one before. That's why I waited so long to see this one. Maybe the low expectation helped, but I loved it. I thought that the flash backs to 12 years ago were great! I thought the visuals were colorful, joyous, and beautiful. I loved seeing the original cast back again. The storyline was a bit of a rip off of It's a Wonderful Life, but who cares? It was warm, Christmasy and very kid appropriate. Even the bad guy gets to be good in the end.",1

"Propaganda

This fictional story was claimed to be of divine inspiration and was used to justify the shedding of blood...this is a prejudiced view against Southerners, who, Library of Congress Records show paid their servants better wages/profit sharing, and provided better housing than the average industrial New York worker of 1900.Mrs. Stowe, and her husband, both shared a very high view of mankind, and a very low view of God.

"Cute, but drags a little toward the middle.

My twin toddlers love Elmo and Sesame Street videos. This is one of the videos they are willing to sit and watch, but it doesn't captivate them like Sing Yourself Silly or Kid's Favorite Songs. The second adventure with Big Bird drags a bit long for them, and they wander away from the TV and start playing with their toys, etc. The third adventure tends to bring them back, though. I should be glad that they have other interests than TV, but we only let them watch the one video a day, and I prefer it to hold their attention.",1

I bought this bag for my Scuba class and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a bag. I should have spent a little more to get something that would actually hold up. The first time I took this bag to class the front area that connects the drawstring to the mesh ripped, this wasn't that bad and I didn't mind. What really got me was when the strap ripped after the third or fourth time using the bag. The stitching ripped away like nothing and now I'm forces to carry it by the drawstring or under my arm. I was very disappointed by this product. Spend a little more money and get something else!",0

Cornwell picks up the saga of Thomas of Hookton and his Grail quest in this second volume of his treatment of the Hundred Years War. From the Battle of Neville's Cross at the beginning to the French siege of La Roche-Derrien at the end, fans of Cornwell's battle scene descriptions will enjoy a feast of arrows and gore. In between there are plenty of new and old villains, the return of Jeanette, and enough ups and downs to keep the pages turning. If you have read the first volume, ""The Archer's Tale,"" you can't stop now--read ""Vagabond,"" and you won't be disappointed.",1

I've been followin' Arson's music since before Life, Rhythm came out, and let me say, he's come a long way in such a short time. In three years, this Aaron Krueger aka Arson Optics has managed to make a name for himself in the hip hop underground. I thought his debut CD was fresh, but his sophomore release was just off the hook. This ""Boy Wonder"" struck back harder then ever, with doper beats and fresher lyrics. He's made a big step up from Life, Rhythm. I'm surprised a professional Record Label hasn't picked up on him yet. That chance only waits to come. This is one talented cat right here, all the production and lyrics are done by him. This album is a must get for all you underground hip hop heads, so don't sleep on this. ONE! -",1

These so called ""techni ice"" packs aren't all that great at all. They don't stay cold longer than any other Ice pack. Actually they thaw quicker. That ""built in refrigerant"" is a complete joke.

Yes the product was very inexpensive, but it is not superior to any other typical ice pack, actually its inferior. And they don't ""stay cold for days""... maybe in a cooler that is never opened, but coolers get opened, they thaw.",0

Now, normally, this is not the type of music I listen to. Not once until this month have I tuned into a Spanish radio station purposely. But my friends, who happen to be from Juarez, lured me away from my R&B; and pop-punk and into their little knot of Latino musica. What can I say except, nada valgo...okay, not really.But seriously, Juanes impressed me with most of his songs. My very favorite is, of course, ""Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor."" I understand Spanish fairly well, and the beautiful lyrics of this song entranced me. Not to mention the catchy beat. I enjoyed other songs as well, including ""Que Pasa?"" and ""Volverte A Ver.""Juanes has brought me into his world of Latino music and I adore it. 'Nuff said.",1

Canon offers a replacement head for $65. Next the ink cleaning reservoir with normal use will fill up in about a year. To replace it will cost $120 and is only available through Canon.

I would like to add my voice to the outrage that this show was released in its edited form. Roseanne was a good show, and does not deserve to be treated like this. Alas, this seems to be a recurring pattern. The first season of ""The Cosby Show"" was also released in its edited form, as was ""ALF."" The good news is that the future seasons will be uncut.

This blade will ONLY fit types 1 and 2.If you have a ""Type 3"" version of the lawn mower, this blade will not fit - the hole is too small to fit over the screw.

All of you who that are complaining about this blu-ray are the one's who purchased this set, come on admit it. Blu-ray 50GB has the room to fit both versions- absolutely right, no argument there. But the fans will never be satisfied. We all knew that this set would be the theatrical editions many months in advance. I had a chance to see this set, and The Fellowship... is a really inferior transfer, but I borrowed the set from a friend who received this for from WB for an advanced review. I will not by this until both versions are available together. The Two..., and The Return... do look promising. A nice step up from the DVD versions. Just remember that blu-ray is still a new format, and we almost certain will not get what we want all the time.

"Wonderful Photos, But Difficult Reading

I gave this 4 stars on the wealth of large, colorful photos and the ideas you can get from those.Had to knock off one star for the difficulty of reading the text. Sentences 25 to 35 words long are difficult to digest (and I have a masters degree). The photo captions are grouped together, forcing the eye to jump back and forth trying to see what is being described. Even the picture captions are such dense text that they require re-reading to figure out what the author is saying. By page 100, I'd abandoned the text and just examined the photos.There are some great ideas to be gleaned from this book. I liked the sliding mirror that revealed a television inset into a bedroom wall. Also great was the hidden storage in stair treads. It's too bad that the text just didn't flow well.",1

""To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday"" is a compelling human drama that is a masterful potpourri of characters drawn together for different reasons to commemorate a tragic anniversary.

The film is masterfully complemented by James Horner's soaring movie soundtrack score. Those who don't like this film were probably thinking that they were going to see a reunion film starring Bob Denver and Alan Hale titled ""To Gilligan on His 57th Birthday."" And, true, they would likely have been more comfortable with a film where the professor and Mary Ann send out invitations to a surprise party written on dried fig leaves.

Musically they are incredibly monotonous, and not very skilled. Almost to a one, all of their songs sound the same. Here is the basic recipe:Fast hard drums + simple chords blasted out on the guitar + the lead singer doing her best impression of a real vocalist = any song on this CD.If they got one thing right on this CD, it's that their music is incredibly generic, and almost a perfect distillation of soulless rock.

why couldn't they make the game to where you could just go straight to skating competitions in front of screaming fans & earning big bucks. here's something else: retro decks IN THE FISHTALE SHAPE not the bannana board, man i hate the bannana board. I've been palying the hawk series games since PS1, & i'm ticked that this game sucks sooo bad. they didn't even think of the folks like myself who've been playin this game since the beginning, we don't wanna have to spend hours having to reaccomplish all the tricks again, mindless repitition, it's boring. there should be a seperate section on the game for beginners. i dunno, but they could've done a much better job. heck i couldn't even get the cheat codes on the game sites to work. i'm selling this game....",0
"DO NOT BUY THIS SOUND CARD!!!

This is not a 5.1 sound card. I repeat. THIS IS NOT A 5.1 SOUND CARD. I have years of experience with computers and with sound systems. I don't know why you would buy this card if it doesn't play 5.1 sound and the resulting sound is no better than the on-board sound. A waste of money. If you are still unconvinced of whether to buy this, then if you do, and in a year's time you need tech support or any type of question for that matter, they will not answer your email.

"Mr. Hinton's fiction...

Many people want Elvis to be alive, and while I'm not 100% sure he's really dead and I am almost 100% sure the story of Elvis's faked death as presented in this book is false.Dr. Hinton paints a picture of a man he believes (but can not prove) is Elvis. Read and judge for yourself, it's hard not to raise questions when you learn going in that Dr. Hinton has always believed Elvis may have faked his death. The book is carefully written to keep Dr. Hinton from presenting himself as a quack. He believes this Jesse is Elvis based on his indirect communications with him. This approach gives Dr. Hinton a sure escape, he doesn't claim Jesse IS Elvis by fact, he only clams to believe Jesse is Elvis by his own faith in the loose evidence he has seen... had I known that going in, I would have saved my money.",0

"When successful writers become greedy

The one plot development that might have saved this mess is if Ryan senior had got wind of what ""The Campus"" and Hanley were doing and outed the whole operation as undemocratic and unsupported by him, proving the pardons to be forgeries. As it is, Clancy shows he has no respect for his readers by allowing this woeful, unlikely storyline to go to print. Due to the lack of editing I feel it has been written and published hastily to fulfil a contractual obligation. Clancy deserves the poor reviews he has received, not only for the poor character development (typical of Clancy) and plodding writing (which some editing would have sharpened), but in one scene he has been so careless as to change a character's name (Wills/Woods). Does Clancy really believe his readers to be so gullible and still buy more. I don't think so...",0

I was greatly disappointed at the responsiveness of the wii-mote on this one. Your moves all seem a beat behind and many of the glitches should have been corrected prior to the release date. This is my first bad experience with the Wii and most of it stems from Madden just being a stale game overall, with very few changes over the last six years or so. There's just no excitement or ""punch"" in this year's version, no hard hitting action and the online mode is an utter disaster. 2 stars for the roster updates, but I can't recommend it unless you're desperate to see how Nintendo handled Madden. Using the nunchuck to control your players may also be just enough to finally push you into that mental institution. I love Nintendo but football may be best played on another system, sorry folks.",0

"Nothing beats this desert life.

Counting Crows are eclipsed by no one. Their lyrics and their music are out of this world. When you listen to this album you will find yourself drawn in by the emotion and the feeling. No other band in the world can write music quite like Adam Duritz can. From 'Hanging Around' all the way through to 'Kid Things', the hidden track, you find yourself taken through the thoughts of a genius mind and love it. Stand out tracks are 'I Wish I Was a Girl' and 'Amy Hit the Atmosphere'. I am seeing them live on March 2nd at the Forum in London and I strongly recommend that you do too. Wherever you can get a ticket for ,then go. Because seeing them live is the ultimate top off to 3 great albums. If you cant see them live then just buy 'Across the Wire - Live in New York' because that is as close as you will get to it. All Counting Crows fans should already have this, so if you know one then dont just take my word for it. Ask them as well.",1
"How do they keep doing this?

Wow. I don't understand how Doug and the rest of Built to Spill can keep putting out such amazing albums. All of them have a distinctly different feel from one another, yet somehow sound comfortable and alike. This album is no different. The song structures seem much simpler and straightforward, but not in a bad way. It seems to me that ol' Doug must have been listening to a lot of southern rock or blues since the last album, as there is a lot more slide guitar rock and straight riff-style guitar playing. Again, different from the rest of their albums, as always, but the same in that it's amazing. PS Doug, in case you're reading this, I bumped into you in an EZ-Mart in Austin after your last show there, and couldn't think of anything of substance to say. I still really can't, I guess, so I'll just say what I'm sure everyone does, and that's that you are great, and your music means a lot to us all.",1

My guess is that he spent all his time in Vegas partying instead of writing and upon returning to NY, not being able to remember many of the salacious facts, just filled in the pages with fluff.The ""Man with the $100,000 Breasts"" is a better read if, like me, you're looking for the fun casino war stories.",0

I tried over and over to adjust the valve to eventually find out that my water pressure was too high but, if I adjust it to the 60 psi that the manufacture recommends than the pump won't keep up.

I purchased this jigsaw only about a month ago, and so far I am very pleased. It feels solid, with smooth cutting action, and goes through a variety of materials with ease. I have to agree with other reviewers regarding the manual, which I too find extremely spartan. However, there has been much reference made regarding the ""quick change"" blade mechanism, and this is what has compelled me to write this review. I too, initially could not lock in the blade, but after a couple of attempts I managed to figure it out (useless manual). Pull back the sliding mechanism, insert the blade to the point of resistance, now you can release the sliding mechanism, and then push the blade harder until you hear a click. The blade is now secure. It may in fact be that some got a bad machine. But give these instructions a try. Hope this helps!",1

So much so why did she even need the hero? And why did I need to care about her?But then we were left hanging by the hero. His attraction to the heroine didn't seem all that defined. Of course she was different than anything he'd ever seen before but I didn't understand why he fell in love with her other than the fact that she was perfect.Considered how thick this book was there wasn't really any plot or conflict.

"no dissent allowed

There is a telling point midway through this film which clearly illustrates this film's way of operating. The late Professor Milton Friedman appears on screen and speaks one sentence conceding a point to the filmmakers but then he is immediately cut off without further comment. Professor Friedman spent his life working as an economist and I would have liked to hear what he had to say regarding the specific issues raised in the film. Is there a way for a film to be partisan without stacking the deck in this way? Professor of Linguistics Noam Chomsky is given lots of time in the film to lecture on economics, a topic on which he is not qualified to speak. A fairer, less slanted film would have let the actual economist have more screen time than the 20 or 30 seconds allowed him.This leads me to wonder why so many Amazon reviewers are satisfied with a film that has such a low regard for it's own audience.",0

I don't know about the 5 star rating given in 2005. This piece of junk is nothing but trouble. Drivers fail to load, apps freeze. There is little to no documentation. No FAQs available on driver conflicts or on how to avoid them. Search the internet and you will find more than a few frustrated people trying to resolve problem after problem. A simple query to Leadtek was never answered. Even their uninstall app for the driver froze the machine.BTW my PC is new and in good shape. You want to capture video? Use something else.",0
"Very soothing!!

I was looking for some bedtime/sleep music, and this is perfect! Very mellow, slow and soothing! Just wonderful! You have to hear it for yourself, though. There are just two tracks, both around an hour or so, which works very well for sleeping. Maybe not something you want to listen to during the day, unless you want to take a break from stress and relax, or even meditate, I suppose!",1

"Classic stainless pattern

Paul Revere was my choice for everyday stainless 44 years ago when I got married. It's simplicity and classic lines have endured time, and still today it makes a beautiful place setting. Through the years it has been wonderful to be able to add additional pieces as needed. One can never have enough teaspoons, so am delighted that Amazon sells the pieces individually. It was no surprise that my son and his wife selected this same pattern for their home. It is timeless!",1

"Nice but I would have rather had book 5

The companion book to me was a disappointment. Much of the information that was in this book is available on Diana's web site. I would much rather have had Diane release book 5 and 6 before getting this published. (You then really could have a companion to the series) I do enjoy Diane's books but after reading this campanion book, I feel that as a fan as I was taken for advantage by buying this book.(Some balm to sooth my cravings but it ISN'T enough!) In spite of this I am waiting most anxiously for the next books and am looking forward to the hope that Diana will give us a ""presequal"" too!!",0
"BORING !

I loved MP4, but MP5 is just plain boring ! I waited and waited for its release and was sadly disappointed in the game. It's slow and not as much fun.

"fake Gospel Gangstas album. Worst ever.

This album is just awful. Every remix is far worse than the original, and they cut a lot of the most powerful lyrics.

KMG made the remixes from the original recordings without any involvement from the artists themselves.Don't buy this album.",0

"Rush - 'Feedback' (Atlantic)

Review no. 212. Until recently, I was never even aware of this Rush EP. Rush gives their longtime loyal followers this eight track EP of '60's rock legend icons who came (and in most cases, were gone) before them. Have to admit it - Rush does a great job on each of these cover songs - as I liked all eight of them the same - from Buffalo Springfield's ""For What It's Worth"" and ""Mr. Soul"" to the Yardbird's ""Heart Full Of Soul"" and the stunning ""Shapes Of Things"". Didn't expect to hear Love's ""Seven And Seven Is"" and The Who classic (one of my all-time Who favorites) ""The Seeker"". Definitely, recommended.",1
"Excellent!

We put this carburetor on our truggy, replacing an Edlebrock. We had problems before with steep inclines causing our old carb to flood.

"Like an AA meeting--but 1000 times more depressing.

Bascially, this book is full of stories about drunk guys that screw up and never get anything fixed. There, that's the whole book in a nutshell. The writing itself is also extremely awkward at times, like where the dialogue is cut out and the narrator goes on for pages describing a conversation without actually letting us hear the conversation. I guess that's about it--same ideas, same results, over and over again in a boring, depressing way.",0

Why? Why does everything have to be 'hipped up' (Or hip-hopped up, as it were)?First of all, lyrically THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS.

Ok, everything doesn't have to be Laurie BErkner and The Wiggles...but how bout fun stuff ...like Yellow Submarine type material...do rock/pop but where's the fun? This Kidz Bop thing is terrible.

"A Great Read!!!

I don't know what else I can possibly say...Everyone else's reviews seem to nail it in the head. The thing I agree with most is how the characters in each story are so vivid - it really sucks you right into the book as if you were really there. I'm so glad these were short stories because I tend to have trouble putting down a really good book(as is the case here)...so I'd be up all night long trying to finish it!!

Few weeks ago I found this book in a yard sale and decided to read it over the weekend.

I had a love/hate relationship with this book because I couldn't put it down, even when I had important things to do! This is not really an intellectual novel, but everyone needs to read some fluffy books sometimes. This is a very unique book told from the perspective of a murdered teenage girl who watches the aftermath of her disappearance unfold from beyond the grave. The story itself is riveting, but the way the book is written makes it even better. I came across portions of the book that were so beautifully written, I had to read them again. Sure, parts of the book are a little out there, but it definitely makes you think about what happens when we die. If you are looking for a ""guilty pleasure"" read that is out-of-the-ordinary, choose this book.",1

This is really a wonderful disk. I particularly enjoy watching it with the second subtitles on.

It could have been done a lot better. Just don't go in with high expectations.",0

"Smug and clueless

Employing evasion and omission in an attempt to deceive the privileged chattering classes rarely makes for riveting film-making, and Swiss director Nicolas Rossier's Aristide and the Endless Revolution is no exception. Apparently ignorant of large swaths of Haiti's history, Rossier is reduced to manipulating archival news footage and mis-translating interviews to attempt to prove his poorly thought-out thesis. Rossier, a Haiti novice who spent little time in the country while making his film, is apparently unaware or uninterested in letting facts complicate what he no doubt finds such a compelling narrative. Better, perhaps, for viewers to have a look at Asger Leth'sGhosts of Cite Soleilto have a more realistic depiction of life in Haiti during recent years, or to search out a real documentary talent like Alex Gibney'sTaxi To the Dark Sidefor the kind of compelling political filmmaking that is so obviously beyond Nicolas Rossier's rather amateurish grasp.",0

Well, the distance stunk, couldn't get more than 20 feet away from the base and the static and crackle was horrible. Then the buttons on one handset would not work properly. I was down to one handset because the first one was junk. I will never buy another General Electric cordless phone as I feel like I threw away $80.00!

My experience with HP products has been pretty dismal. My hopes for better results with a fancier model were dashed when my HP 6122 stopped communicating with my Mac. The local computer repair shop charges $70 for a diagnostic look, applicable to the repair. Unfortunately for me, the defective USB connector in the printer cannot be obtained. I guess it was worth $70 to finally learn that HP printers are break-down, non-repairable crap.As I've had two previous HP printers to die on me, it's three strikes and you're out, Hewlett Packard.

"Turn off the sound !

I don't know what the fuss is all about. The story is mediocre. The villains are hardly a challenge for the hero. The acting is B-movie standard. The music however.... The music is something else, let me tell you;There is this operatic voice of a woman that keeps telling the story as it progresses, explaining the emotions of the characters as the story unfolds. If that wasn't bad enough the lead character in his thick european accent starts joining in, singing backup about the pain and suffering he is going through. I either had to lower the volume or fast forward through most of the movie it was so unbearable. Do yourself a favour, catch a western where Ennio Morricone does the score like A Fistfull of Dollars or The Great Silence. This western was too painfull to watch with the sound on.",0

"Lacking Protection

Bought this bag and am returning it.Pros:-Configurable interior compartments.-Design is OK. Not super stealth but pretty inconspicuous.-Fairly large front pouch for accessories.-Easy to get to camera.-Roomy.Cons:-Too easy to get to camera/equipment. Even when shut as tight as possible, you can easily reach in from the side and grab your camera. This was the deal breaker for me. I can just see water/dust making it's way into the main compartment.-Almost no padding on the top cover (where your LCD is facing up).-Kinda cheap build quality. OK for the price but the materials definitely seemed kinda cheap to me.-Loud velcro closure on for main compartment.

"A Classic Movie in Every Sense of the Word

I had hoped to update this movie to a DVD copy but apparently it is only available in VHS at this time; I already have one of those. Jane Fonda has seldom been given credit for her acting ability, probably because too many people focused on her politics and protests during the Vietnam Era. She has a lot of talent, just like her father did, and more so than her brother, Peter. The Dollmaker should be considered a film classic, even though it's very existence is not that well known! Whether you buy the VHS version now, or wait in hopes of getting a DVD; I would suggest putting it on you wish list; you won't regret it!",1

I very much enjoyed ""Sole Survivor"". I read a lot of Koontz when I was younger but hadn't in many years. This was a great book to start back in with and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The action was non-stop and it kept me wondering until the very end. The only thing that I dis-liked a wee bit was the uber descriptive prose. Sometimes it was several pages of blah blah and all it was saying was ""a tumble weed went buy"". LOL! But aside from that being a bit bothersome a time or two the story, the characters, I really enjoyed very much. It's definitely worth a read.",1
"The Best Season of Batman:TAS

I bought this DVD because I remember liking this new version beter than any episode of the last 3 seasons, and they don't air reruns on Boomerang. Let me tell ya, it's worth the money. The costumes of both the villians and the heroes look way better than they did in those older episodes. The episodes are way more actiony, and that's a good thing for an action lover, like myself. Plus, there's one crossover episode called ""Girl's Night Out"", where Super Girl and Batgirl team up to defeat Livewire, Poison Ivy & Harly Quin. Some of the best episodes are:-Sins of the Father-Double Talk-Never Fear-Joker's Millions-Old Wounds-Legends of the Dark Knight-Beware the Creeper-Judgement DaySpecial features include:-Commentary-Interactive Arkham Asylum-Languages & subtitlesOn the downside, there's too many episodes with Batgirl. That's the only downside I can think of. This product gets a 4/5. Kudos to WB.",1

"When Will This End?!

I borrowed this DVD from my friend, who got held back in high school. As I went through it, I noticed something very strange and familiar. Most of Korn's fans are kids. Mostly kids buy their cd's. Jonathan Davis always sings about crap that happened to him when he was a kid. I then turned off the DVD when to go for a walk and ponder my maturity. I think Korn needs to grow up. I mean, they still put out good material, but they need a new quality to appeal to. I have their self-titled album as well as Follow The Leader. Why are two-discs necessary?!",0
"Excellent follow up to Trio

Sheer beauty is the only way to describe the gorgeous harmonies of these three talented ladies. And this follow up was well worth the wait. Rondstadt is powerful on High Sierra, Harris balladeers beautifully on You'll Never Be The Sun and Parton performs with heartbreaking power on He Rode All The Way To Texas as well as After The Goldrush. And when all the voices meet it is enough to give you goosebumps. Thank God this jewel of an album is finally seeing the light of day. Someone mentioned earlier that they did not hear Dolly on The Blue Train. She is in fact featured in the haunting echos in the background of the song towards the end.

"Poor quality, uncomfortable inflexible PVC piece of cr*p

I ordered these from another vendor. The moment I opened the box and put them on, it was a huge shock for me. Theglowing reviews on these made me buy them but I was never this disappointed with any purchase in my life.Let me explain -The sandals look about ten times better in the picture than in real lifeThey look and feel real cheap and are extremely uncomfortable. Sandals made of PVC? PVC is supposed to be for tubing, not sandals. It makes the sandal rigid and inflexible. Flexibility is necessary for comfort. Also, these run about 2 sizes short. I ordered a 11.5 even though I was a 11 and it felt like it was a 10 and real tight. I imagine that even if the size was right, it would still be very uncomfortable. These are cheap, chinese made junk that are best rejected at the port of entry. Dont be seduced by the photograph showing all those nice looking water holes, it is a piece of cr*p these sandals",0

"Good in a pinch, but better guides are out there

We live in the mountains in North Central New Mexico. We put up a backyard birdfeeder, and for the first time in my life I've tried to identify all of our seasonal visitors. Many of the birds that we most frequently see - specifically juncos, finches and woodpeckers - are much different looking than the pictures in this book. I have found the Peterson Field Guide of Western Birds to far more accurately depict the birds we see, especially when it comes to identifying different subspecies for our area.",0
"Get back to School Kanye

I have always enjoyed Kanye West. Since hip-hop has strayed away from relevant lyricists Kanye was like a breath of fresh air. When College Drop Out and Late Registration dropped it reminded me of hip hop legends like Del the Funky Homosapien and The Pharcyde. His delivery has never been that great, but his beats were always on point and there was definite substance to his rhymes. So when Graduation came out I picked it up as soon as possible. And while his production skills are still at the top of the game, Kanye has succumbed to the hip hop mentality of braggadocios rhymes. The heart just isn't in it anymore. We always knew that Kanye was his own #1 fan, but now that's all he is. He's saying a lot without saying anything at all.",0

"DON'T ORDER THIS TERRIBLE PACKAGE OF GREAT MOVIES!

Having seen all these superb Hitchcock films before, I was expecting to enjoy the wonder of DVD viewing to enhance the next times around.

The Return of the King is a good movie.The reason I didn't give it five stars is because that- I already knew by the title what was going to happen.- I sat next to this bloody kid who couldn't stop joking aboutLegalos dress (god damn).- The battle of Pelanor Fields wasn't long enough.- Why did Aragorn go off the the caves again??- Arwen didn't know her role.- Shelob's chase wasn't as scary as in the book, which I felt,would have given it five stars if the caves chasing bit wasput it.- Where's the story of Eowyn?

Professor Kaku's Visions is no doubt a good book. However, it doesn't contain much depth that will keep the reader interested for very long.This book is one of those books that predicts that future, but does nothing much.

This movie is one of the most mind-boggling I've ever seen. More than a year after I've watched it for the first time, it is still opening my eyes, opening them so wide that I get sleepless when thinking about it at night.For this movie is about the fate of humanity. This movie is about why it is better to suffer here on earth than any kind of beatitude in a blissful paradise. This movie is about the inevitability and the adventure of change, it just shouts CHANGE! CHANGE! CHANGE! at you, and the backwards message of the movie is that if you don't, then you'll fade to grey. This movie shows you why civilizations clinging to the past are bound to disappear like dinosaurs because you just cannot prevent change, that children will be thinking differently than parents because this is the way humanity progresses, and that the one motor for change, for putting color in our world, for making it different, is the human mind and its craving for discovery.Gary Ross, you're a genius.",1

As a long time VB and ASP programmer, retraining for Java or C# is a mind-boggler. After taking a class on OO Analysis and Design, I can now make sense out of the paradigm of OO, and appreciate it's benefits. But the paradigm shift is so great, that one probably needs more than the syntax training and introductory level OO concepts presented in this book to be successfull with OO. However this is not the author's fault. If you already grasp OO concepts, this book provides superb examples of how to move from procedural syntax and program structures to use inheritance,polymorphism, and encapsulation as provided by Java.",1
"Disappointing

Why I have to give credit to Christopher for experimenting with multiple points of view, he didn't pull it off successfully. Most of Eragon's story was dull description of the elves' home (which reminded me heavily of descriptions from LoTR) while Nasuada's was too short and came off as a cheap way to show the audience what was happening to the Varden. With the exception of a couple chapters, Roran's pov was the more interesting of the three because he actually did some important things during it. The pacing was overall a bit long as well and some parts felt like they could have benefited from more editing. I truthfully preferred Eragon over this book.",0
"""Ripper"" not a ""barnburner""""

What's not to like? Murder fans' favorite unidentified serial killer and America's bestselling crime novelist together at last? Who could resist such a pairing! I read the much-anticipated latest from Patricia Cornwell with a great deal of disappointment. The style is tangential (or the organization of the material just escapes me); the evidence to support Sickert's guilt is compelling, but doesn't make for a good read, interspersed as it is with Ms. Cornwell's insistent speculation about his behavior and the meaning/connection of events. There is no tension in this book and, despite her success as a novelist, Ms. Cornwell is neither a forensic pathologist or a psychiatrist--how does she become such an expert on the evidence, then? And where is Kay Scarpetta when we need her most?",0

"Itching Ears

This man should be ashamed of himself, and his publishing staff for giving occasion for enemies to blaspheme. On page 18 (which I'm embarrassed to admit I read beyond) Myles exposes the source of his heresy, but considerately, he doesn't name the ""friends in a faraway country"" who gave him the book ""The Long Search"". Myles, if you're going to write a book on the Kingdom of God, use the Bible as research material. It clearly teaches that NOT all religions are ""a result of man's attempt to respond to his desire to find some type of meaningful, and possibly intimate, relationship with a Supreme Being"" (pg. 18), instead, the Bible teaches that Judeo Christian religions were initiated by Jehovah God. Did you maliciously intend to miss this? Or have you not read the Bible Myles? I know this is a book review, but I would like an answer... from your readers perhaps.",0
"Good-Looking but Vacuous and Overripe

Barbra Streisand has made a very good-looking movie, and competently directed a very good cast, so this movie isn't a total dud. The problem lies in the story itself. It's simply too unbelievable, formulaic (the ""childhood trauma"" at the center of the film doesn't have any resonance, it's simply a glibly Freudian attempt to tie the narrative together), and full of overripe rhetoric that cannot disugise the vacuity of the tale.The one redeeming feature in this film is Nick Nolte's SUPERB performance.

"INCREDIBLE lens!

first off, this is NOT an easy lens to use. when you are at 5x , your focus point is about the between the size of a pin head and 1/2 dime size. That being said - you can get some absolutely STUNNING photos. It takes patience and practice, practice, practice. A macro flash is a MUST for this lens - especially at 5x -- because you need to be at f/16 to get any DOF at all. I have not purchased this lens - I am currently renting from local camera shop. I've had it 3 days, and I am addicted to it. I keep finding more and more things to gigantize. It is also must to have a good tripod and a trigger release. Pushing the button on the camera could EASILY move your subject out of focus.All that being said - this is an AWESOME lens.

"She could actually sing...

Some say she was a ""Madonna"" clone. I guess due to the fact the they both used the same producer for their hits, Stephen Bray, and their voices and style were similar. But the difference is Regina could sing. She had a bit of a soulful range that Madonna couldn't match. Unfortunately Madonna's marketing saavy beat out substance like it usually does with most singers, including the late Teena Marie, who didn't sound like Madonna at all. But again, this album, though it's very pop oriented, is very likeable. Unfortunately, Regina didn't do a follow-up to this album and who knows of her whereabouts. A very good album that unfortunately, along with the singer, has gone into the box of obscurity. Can we say, ""Curiousity"" killed the CD??...:)",1

If you want to be able to learn useful phrases quickly, this is a great intro to the language.

I have tried other language cds, and I think the Pimsleur approach is so different and effective, that it's really worth the price difference. I'm going to save my pennies to get the full set as soon as I can!The only drawback of this set is that it has only 16 lessons. It ended way too quickly, and made me want more!",1
"Not great.

I ordered this thing so that I could hand written take notes on my Fire. I find the tip to be too soft and squeeshy to emulate writing. I already have a finger print protective film on the display, so that is a non-issue. Therefor, this thing just sits, unused. I wouldn't buy one of these again.",0
"Cheaper then cheap

I purchased this flashlight thinking it would be a perfect little item for observing without destroying my eyes. It is a terrible flashlight, it doesn't show almost anything unless it is on full power, and it is the cheapest made thing I have ever held in my hand. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy one of these. I took it apart and the internal components are just junk. The outer shell is a very flexible plastic that could easily break if you tried. The light if dropped would implode in my opinion. I have used it and it was slightly helpful, hence the two stars. Save your money though and buy something that actually works as it is intended. The quality control team at Celestron needs some pointers.",0

"When will Microsoft get it???

I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) and have used both the 3 ringed binder materials as well as the self-study materials. Both are blessed by Microsoft, and as the description states, are identical; they in fact are.With that said I've taught 832 and 833 classes and I can state that in no way will the instructor led nor the self-study course prepare you for the exams. Why you ask? Well I took t he Beta Exams for both parts of the SQL Server exams and I can tell you that the Microsoft courses fail greatly at preparing you for the exam.Suggest you wait for Transcender to come out with their practice exams and study them well, in particular the explainations given for the correct and incorrect answeres. Buy only the books, etc they used as references. You will be miles ahead and money saved.Regards,Steve Grigsby, MCSE, MCT, MCP+I and soon MCDBA",0

I just adopted a 5 year old deaf girl. I've had a hard time finding a book that she can relate to. I was hoping this book would focus more on being deaf, wearing hearing aids, showing the kids using ASL, what makes a deaf child/school different than a hearing one, etc. Instead it's a boring book about going to school, typing a letter on a computer, and learning to sign ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"". Boring, Boring, Boring! I am so happy that I only bought this one ""Moses"" book and I will be returning it tomorrow.",0

"Under written

The cd has great sound quality. That said, it's fairly easy to write music that is not going to sound all jumbled or may be at such a strict tempo that it's more interesting. I believe the band has the talent to explore a more modern style with their talent using less formatted song structure. Anyone who can play power chords could be in the band, another way of saying that is the guitar players lack their own style making ability that other bands guitarists' are known for.",0
"good idea, bad software and support

I wish I would have read the reviews first before buying. I got the version for MAC and it has been three frustrating days now and still no copy of my tapes to CD.

However I cannot get the file to burn to CD, go to itunes or export in any manner,nor can I register the product or get any customer support. I can't even send to ""toast"" as it wants me to purchase a new copy for $100 more dollars.The key code on the cd sleeve always says wrong id number when entered. The Phone number on the web site has a recording that says I've reached the wrong line and hangs up. And there is no answer to emails that i've sent. I've decided to take the item back.

The cookbook cards recipes were totally useless, I don't know where they pulled out those miraculously short cooking times. Ours turned out to be a good 2-3 times longer, and cooking meat on it is OK if you like to eat steamed/boiled meat.The only thing it does well is steam vegetables, where it finally did live up to its ""turbo"" name. Cooking pasta with it is OK too but using so little water left the pasta with a bit of a slimy coating.If you absolutely must try this product, hang on to your receipt and buy it from [some local stores that] have no-hassle return policies.",0

"Faulty Delivery Thwarts Good Products

This was the first download that we ordered after being enticed by Amazon's email promoting ""instant"" video services. This offer claimed that, for a flat annual fee (a mere ~$79) we could enjoy one year of prime instant video downloads. Upon sign in and selection, the product was neither included in the flat fee (credit card was charged) nor was the download instant. When we opened the item on our TiVo, the listing showed that the program would be available in 19hours (we have 25Mb FiOS service) and some minutes - in fact, it didn't become available for nearly two days. Very disappointed with Amazon's failure to run Quality Control on its own site to ensure that customers can actually receive what is promoted. (Lest one wonders, the selection of this program which failed to meet delivery expectations, was made after several attempts to locate the expected ""recognition"" of our newly acquired status as a subscriber to this promoted service.)",0

Although Dickens may have liked this book best, it doesn't come close to Hard Times, Christmas Carol, or Tale of Two Cities. David Copperfield drags.

"Simmons continues to please

I am surprised by the people who thought this book was boring. If anyone would be bored by this book, I would have expected it to be me. I don't really enjoy reading history, and I have never really gotten into reading spy novels. The only reason I even read it was because Simmons is one of my favorite authors, so I figured I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. The fact that much of this novel was based on actual events in Hemmingway's life is what made it so interesting to me. The spy stuff in this book was interesting and believable, unlike most spy novels which are bloated with so much unbelievable superhuman action and heroism. I highly reccommend it.",1
"Sonic tranquilizer

If Pfizer could figure out how to put Arvo Part's music into a pill, they'd corner the market on sleeping aids. I've listened to this CD 10-15 times in its entirety, trying to pay close attention to the nuances of text and phrasing. I don't see the appeal of music like this, which is as grey and monochromatic as the front cover of the CD booklet.I must note, however, that the singing (particularly that of the Evangelist) is breathtakingly beautiful. Recording quality is also outstanding; you feel as if you're sitting in a deserted church on a cold, windy day.",0
"Waste of money

This toy was purchased for our 9-month old daughter, and not only did she hate it, but we hated it, too. First of all, the music is deafening. It scared all of us the first time we turned it on! Also, the motor that makes the balls pop out of the top is really loud. Oftentimes, the balls fly across the room, and you have to chase after them. (They really like to hide underneath couches and beds...) The first time we set our daughter down to see it, she screamed in terror. It's ridiculous to buy this toy for anyone under the age of 18-months, and I think it's very misleading that the box recommends the toy for 9-months and up. Unfortunately, the family member who bought the toy did not keep their receipt, and the day after we received it, we gave it to Goodwill. Good riddance!",0
"An interesting overview

This book seems to be a fairly complete overview of the subject. Its one recurring flaw is that the text sometimes reads as if the author believes that he is the first to notice the connections between American (and European) Eugenics and the Nazis. I doubt if the author intended that, but that is still the impression sometimes left.This is a very readable book, and well-suited for undergraduate use.",1

This is a truly wonderful movie in spite of the one dimentional plot line. The music is sensational and inspirational and the actors are having a great time with their performances here.The tone of the movie is definately not R rated so the content is suitable for families. Beyonce does an amazing job being sexy and spiritual and Cuba Gooding Jr. shows off his gymnastic capabilities with ease as well as his ability to poke fun at himself.This is certainly no cinematic wonder nor is it a deep character study with contrasting plot lines - however, just watching Beyonce perform in the choir scenes and listening to the incomparable O'Jays is enough reason to buy this DVD. Just buy it to feel inspired and laugh.",1

I previously considered myself a HUGE Stephenson fan but after reading Quicksilver I'm not even sure I will read the next 2 installments.

For anyone who enjoys history, and especially Italian Renaissance history, this is a gem! This book is an examination of marriage as a legal institution and the prescribed roles of both men and women in it. By examining two actual persons involved in a legal case about the validity of their marriage, Lusanna and Giovanni, Brucker allows the reader a rare glimpse into a more personal type of history- a microhistory, that tries to show the greater mores and norms of Renaissance Florence through the interpretation of a legal case. Although not an easy read, and why should it be, this is an excellent introduction to anyone interested in more detailed historical analysis of law and social institutions in the Renissance.",1

Just like that, my back pain was gone. A few days later I played tennis again and the back pain returned. This time I did the entire DVD and felt great afterwards.

"Misguided information and ratings of Zoo exhibits.......

It is unfortunate that Mr. Nyhuis has focused on some old fashioned ideas of what a good Zoo is. ie: He has rated Tropic World at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, as one of the top exhibits in the Zoo world. I have just visited the Zoo and was thoroughly disapointed and often horrified at the lack of realism and any real sense of theTropics. It is this complete difference of opinion that makes me question Mr. Nyhuis criteria of what a good exhibit is. He must base his opinion on size and grandeur. Tropic World is surely immense! However, it's size is it's biggest problem because of it's lack of quality on such a grand scale. Jungle World at NY's Bronx Zoo so far surpasses Tropic World in every way that it is an abomination to even compare the two. This is just one example of Mr. Nyhuis flawed reviews of Zoo's and thier exhibits.",0

"Tedious

One of the most boring and unattractive books I have ever read. What an unfortunate idea to give a running commentary on the events rather than let the reader enjoy the events themselves. I often wondered whether I was reading a badly written essay rather than a novel. Instead of a good story about the racial and political complexities of a colonial (and post-colonial) society you get an exercise in style. Self-indulgent sophistication makes this a tedious read.

"A great read!

I'm a longtime Lansdowne fan and it's difficult to say how much I enjoyed reading SHALL WE DANCE? Let's just say, I hugged the book when I was done, I kid you not, and sighed. It was a wonderful read, with lovable, eccentric characters, witty, quirky dialogue, a bit of mystery and suspense - and, of course, romance - bravo!!!I can't agree with the previous reviews - I buy these books, and love them, for some of the very reasons others panned them. (Note: reading MY FAIR QUIGGLEY prior to reading this one will help the reader appreciate who everyone is.) I love the richness of the characters, and the many secondary characters, to me, just show off Lansdowne's talent for ""quirky and funny"". I read to be entertained, to be taken away to another place, and to fall in love with the characters... all my expectations were fulfilled when I read this book. Thanks, Ms. Lansdowne!",1
"This well-made puppet has personality plus!

I simply fell in love with this little guy. In a world of talking toys and electronic distractions, puppets provide gentle, invaluable opportunities for learning, including self-discovery, therapy, and storytelling.As a parent and a teacher, this puppet is by far one of the best I've found in a long time. It is well-made; the seams are tightly sewn, and the hand placement is comfortable for a variety of different hand-sizes - both child and adult. The little nut that he holds is attached by a very short, wide grosgrain ribbon (not a flimsy string). And unlike many stock puppets these days, this squirrel has tons of personality: after only a few minutes of interaction with my daughter, I almost forgot that he was a puppet at the end of my hand.",1
"Not Even For Free

I made a terrible mistake and bought this game for $49.99 the day it came out. If I waited a month (which I wished I did) I could've bought it for $20. This has to be by far one of the worst games I ever played. Needless to say I played it for about 45 minutes and quit, I never played it again. I thought it was boring, graphics and movement were terrible. Honestly if someone gave me this game for free I wouldn't take it. I love the books, all 3 movies were great, this game shouldn't exist. I wasn't too impressed with the other Lord of the Rings Games either but this one is definately the worst out of all. Try to avoid this one at all cost.",0
"A VERY DISSAPOINTING BOOK !!!!

This book is a real waste of time. I started reading it and realized that all the author did was watch the documentary ""The Fear of God"" and wrote the book. There are numerous references and quotes taken from the documentary and I do mean many. I literally thought this was a draft for the documentary. There is really nothing original or new that you don't already know. Save your money. I was so dissapointed that I returned the book the same day without finishing it!",0
"Ugh. Should be Zero Stars

The title of the review says it all. This was the worst movie of the year, and one of the few times I ever wished I had walked out of the theater early. Special effects cannot make up for a thin, unbelievable plot. If you are going to set a movie in the real world, nearly a century ago, try and stick with historically accurate props and storylines. A rocket powered blimp just doesn't cut it.",0
"I managed to get through this movie without losing my mind, others were not so lucky!

I love The Crow movies! The first Crow with Brandon Lee is one of my all time favorites!The Crow: City Of Angels... well, they took the first crow movie and pretty much dragged itthrough the dirt, but it turned out to be an okay movie!The Crow: Salvation: A B-movie/made for T.V. movie... second rate cinema but not bad in theend though!Now... The Crow: Wicked Prayer;What I didn't like about this movie:1. The diolague made no sense at all!2. The plot made no sense!3. The score was a waste!4. So many actors who made themselves look bad by being in this movie (EdwardFurlong, Tara Reid, David Boreanaz, etc.)!5. Edward Furlong's make-up kept changing through-out the movie!8. Even the special features were bad!9. The book 'The Crow: Wicked Prayer' was good but this movie was terrible!Bottom line: This movie is one of the worst movies ever made!Avoid it at all costs! I'm not even close to kidding!My grade: F or no stars!",0
"Puzzled

I am puzzled over the generally positive reviews of this book. There are some interesting anecdotes throughout the book. However, the general thesis does not seem well supported by the specific examples. There are numerous factual errors and claims unsupported by the data he cites. In addition, there are a large number of conclusions drawn from data that seems to support the opposite conclusion. Much of the book is devoted to providing new names to common behaviors and activities and then attempting to justify the notion that some new truth has been discovered. I think Ross Johnson, erstwhile CEO of RJR said it best, Gladwell has provided with numerous BGOs (Blazing Glimpse of the Obvious).What I find especially puzzling is the tremendous popularity of this book and his subsequent book ""Blink."" I certainly am not interested in reading anything he writes in the future.There are far better ways to spend 4-5 hours of your life than reading this book.",0

The Bible cannot be used as proof of anything since there is no evidence to support that anything in the bible is accurate.

"lost,lonely and soooooooooooo bag but worth the watch

I was 6 years when this film made its debut in Tuscalosa, Alabama at the Bama theatre. I went to see this movie destined for movie oblivion and drive -ins with my two brothers, Mom and Dad. I saw this terrible but sickly likable movie along with the majority of Tuscalosa elite because my dad is in the film. He plays the reporter name Clint who tries to get the inside scoop on the ""star"". My father was the general manager at the Stafford Hotel where the location and some of the interior shots weredone. The director felt obligated to put Dad in because of the use of the hotel for the majority of film done there. He appears in two scenes. Sceneone at a restaurant (he's the short guy with the hat on talking to two of the ""star's"" friends) and scene two at the debut of the star's newest movie. He even got to say hello to the soon to be love interest in Lost, Lonely, and you know. Check out this celluloid nonsense and if you see my dad, say hi.",1
"Guess I'm Unlucky.

I had to sit through this while babysitting 2 kids a couple of months ago. Crikey - what a bad film this is. Granted, it's aimed squarely at the pre-teen brigade, but surely even they deserve better than this. Funnily enough, the two central butter-wouldn't-melt Barbie characters are probably the least annoying aspect of the film.

"Do NOT buy HP

I had this TV for 2 1/2 years and loved it. We had issues with the volume difference between watching movies and TV but other then that no problems at all. Until.........my husband was watching TV and all of a sudden the picture was gone. After trying to figure out the problem ourselves, we called HP. It was going to cost us $629 for them to come out. If they didn't fix it, it would still cost us $369. I think that is crazy for such a newer model of TV. We could not order the part or take it to another place to fix it. Our local TV repair person said that HP does not give out their diagrams to repair places. You have to go threw HP. So now we have a worthless flat screen that is to new to just throw away. We can almost buy a new TV for the price they want to repair it so we are kind of stuck. So DO NOT buy HP! The good reviews are from people that haven't had it go out yet but it will. We loved our TV to up until last week. We looked it up online and it is a huge problem.",0
"A space opera reminiscent of star wars

An easy read that will make you feel good, but not very challenged. There is usually little doubt as to what will happen next, but the characters are interesting at times (even if they are somewhat cariacatured). The warlike Barryarans and peacenik Betans don't display much variety, but the character of Miles Vorkosigan is interesting to read in action. Lois Bujold gets better with her later novels about this strange universe set in a future where humans migrated to the stars as tribes and lost touch with each other for a time and then found each other again. The Barrayarans appear to be made to resemble the Soviets (warlike and totalitarian), while the Betans are Anglo-American democratic pacifists. All in all Bujold is a good writer (as she proves with some later adventures starring Miles), but here she appears to be experimenting and growing still. Not bad and not the best, but it's a better read than most other science fiction out there.",1

Here was my experience with this stuff. I shaved with Proraso shave soap and I got an extremely rich lather. I also, shaved with a top of the line electric razor from panasonic.

It starts getting irritated after day one. But, I put some of this Proraso Liquid Cream after shave on and it's magic. It minimized my razor bumps and irritations and my face felt incredibly smooth and comfortable. This stuff is magic in the fact that it soothes your face and keeps it from getting irritated.Why? Because it is alcohol free! It contains Witch Hazel, Vitamin E, and other natural elements for those with a sensitive face that gets easily irritated.",1
"What a difference a year makes.

A year ago, I would have described this book as a valuable resource for a person new to Paganism and trying to find a path. Over the last year I have made more of an effort to learn about the differences between the various Neopagan religions and now find this book does not do justice to the real diversity of thought and practice that exists. In fact, this book does what many Neopagans do, which is attempt to homogenize Paganism into some universal religion with different flavored sects. The book is weak and ultimately deceptive.",0

While I agree it was a fantastic concert (I was lucky enough to be there) the VHS tape & the CD wars very disappointing for the reasons I am about to write.They didn't include the entire concert and I was also very disappointed in the Mixing. For example, when George Harrison first came out, he sang ""If Not For You""-where is that song on the Video and CD? Was it a mistake? I am also disappointed in the Mixing--they (Columbia) made it way too ""commercial"" in that the rawness of the music is missing. For example, towards the end of the song ""My Back Pages"" (a highlight of the Concert) Neil Young sang the final ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now"" as a solo. They kept the camera on him but when you hear the rest of the people singing-it looks and sounds strange. If they ever put this out on DVD, I hope they won't mess with it too much.

"'Lovely Bones' meets 'Ghost'

So many comparisons to 'The Lovely Bones', but to me it echoed the movie 'Ghost' in it's themes of great loves that are tragically lost,and how one moves through that pain. (okay, if 'Ghost' was made up of highly intelligent and culturally progressive men and women.)Still, at it's core, this is one big fat romantic story covering nearly a century in the life and afterlife of Razi Nolan, a young woman on the early cusp of the woman's movement whose life is tragically cut short. She chooses to live in the world between life and death in order to discover what became of her one great love Andrew. Their story is interspersed with a young married couple going through their own issues invloving loss, who she chooses to 'haunt'.Beautifully written, it's a book I found myself devouring in large quantities like a favorite ice cream.

WWF The Music Volume 5 is a good CD, but I think Volumes 3 and 4 are better. Triple H, Angle, Billy Gunn, and Benoit's themes are the best. It's a good CD, but there is a lot missing (Stone Cold, Hardy Boyz, Dudley Boyz, Acolytes, Radicalz) and some that we could've went without (Too Cool, Lita, and definately Pie). Pie is the worst track on this CD. It was way too overrated and i think it simply sucks. If you like the WWF Themes, buy it.",1
"I Agree with the Three Previous 1-star Reviews

No directions, didn't fit bike pedals. The ""plastic"" may be useful elsewhere.Normally no directions is okay but when I couldn't install them, this was odd. Besides, most items have directions in 10 different languages. What product lacks ANY (there were ZERO directions). Shampoo has frickin' directions. The most ridiculous things have directions. Preposterous these had no directions nor specs. What were these imbeciles thinking? They just (erroneously) assume they'll work for all bike pedals? Very sloppy and unprofessional they didn't even denote which pedals they'll work for and which ones they won't.",0

Got this for my 14 month old for Christmas ... a month later he still plays with it every day.

Nice to be abe to stack the blocks together also. Like it much better than the other sorter he had :-)",1

Gardenia is one of my favorite flowers because the fragrance is sweet and delicate. This product however is far from representing the natural fragrance.

"Too much of a (re)mixture

I like the first three songs (Cité Tango, Round About Midnight, Confianzas -- La Cumparsita is too short to really be considered a song). But then the CD starts to lose focus. The Man takes too long to really get going; Percussion is just a bore; and then you find that there are remixes of La Del Ruso, El Capitalismo Foréno, Tríptico and Santa Maria from La Revancha del Tango, not as good as the originals IMO -- simply annoying. If GoTan want to do remixes, fine, but put them on a CD of remixes, not one that customers think is new material. Tres Y Dos isn't GoTan style material at all; M.A.T.H even less so: English (and rap, at that) on a GoTan CD!!! Puh-leese! As well as this CD, I have La Revancha del Tango, Lunático, and Tango 3.0, and I love them (even Tango 3.0, which many fans seem to be disappointed in also) -- but I can't enjoy most of this CD.",0
"Cockpit Trash

This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Or make that started to read. I had to throw it in the trash it was so awful. Being a former airline employee, I thought this would be a funny look at airline life. Instead, all the author talks about are the many trysts he encounters along the way. Plus, he uses foul language like there's no tomorrow. I'm also astounded that this book ever got past editing in it's current condition. It is the worst editing job I have ever seen. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone!",0

"BEWARE!!!! BAD VERSIONS of DVD SOLD to CUSTOMERS!!!!!!!

Ok...So I purchased this DVD( USED )from a seller on Amazon. When I played the movie I noticed the Director's voice commentary through out as the movie played. Immediately I stopped the movie and checked every last setting icon on the DVD menu. So after 20mins of frustration without any luck of removing the Director's Commentary...I then realized this unfortunately is how the DVD was manufactured. After much disappointment, I'm left wondering ""Why would the Seller think a customer would want to purchase a movie with an annoying voice speaking through the entire movie?"" So unfortunately I can't return the DVD. I would now just like to purchase a NEW copy from Amazon, but I'm scared of ending up with the same BAD VERSION. Can anyone help me in choosing the right copy? I still want the NC-17 version just without the Directors's Commentary.",0

I received this book as a gift before my son was born. When I first tried to show it to him, he was I think about 3 or 4 months old - he wasn't very interested. However, once at 6 months, he started to show more interest & would look at the pages as I turned them - within a few weeks, he was clearly listening to me telling the story, looking at the pictures & turning the pages himself. I don't think he knows what the words are all about, but it seems funny how he seems to be turning them against Grover's will. It has spurred me on to buy him other board storybooks ASAP.",1
"Great product! Good price!

I love these seat covers. I have one for the front seat and one for the back seat of our F350. Our boxers go everywhere with us and these protect the seats of our new truck. My only complaint is that they are a little hard to take off and put on. We ended up putting big towels over the seat covers so we could take them out and shake them or wash them as needed more easily than taking the entire seatcovers out. I have washed them several times and they wash up nicely. I even put them in the dryer with the hooks and clips removed.",1

My 3-year old son loves this DVD. It's very cute and helps calm fears of going to the doctor. It features elmo who comes down with a sore throat and has to go to the doctor where he sees the other Sesame Street characters in the waiting room with other ailments. The characters are seen by the doctor, who listens to their heartbeat, checks their throat and does all the other ""scary"" things that your child's pediatrician does. Great for easing fears of the doctor by showing that the doctor is there to make them feel better. Many cute songs, and lots of Sesame Street puppets...We love this DVD and have no regrets in this purchase.",1
"Okay, not perfect

It was better than the Thinkbaby bottles we started with, but we did have some issues. Sometimes they leaked for no particular reason. The larger size nipple (we didn't use them much when we still needed the smaller nipple) leaked (or sometimes shot out) milk if our daughter tipped it over. We didn't care for all the parts either - they were easy to misplace and took longer to get a bottle ready for a hungry infant. Other than those concerns, though, we found them to be sturdy and to hold up where the Thinkbaby bottles were in tatters.",1

I'm so happy that this game came out... especially for the GBA! Nintendo made a whole lot of people happy by releasing not only the GBA but Mario World!

There are several interesting twists to this version: dragon coins exist in castles and fortresses, and Luigi is selectable and he's in his SMB2 form. So Luigi can be a little hard to get used to at first. They've should have brought both Toad and Peach as playable characters like in SMB2. This game is just as fun as it was when it was first released in 1990.Some things should never be outgrown, even for a man the ripe old age of 24.",1
"Confused

I have owned these headphones for about 3 years and cannot say enough about them. What I am confused about is all the reviews mixed about the sound. I believe the sound is incredible, I have compared them to the Denon AH-NC732 and the Sennheiser HD-280 and these Bose have a better overall sound. The Denon's are very close with the sound, but the on ear takes away from the overall sound quality to me and sound like crap without the noise canceling on. The HD280's sound great in mid and highs but the bass is lacking. I have compared these headphones on every genre and I just cannot hear how people say they sound better. As far as the construction, after 3 years of using them everyday all day at work, there is no cracks or any sign of fatigue that I can see. Maybe I just got lucky and received a well built pair.",1

"I Like Gwen Stefani...

...but, this album did absolutely nothing for me. It had its high points. The lyrics were okay, but she won't win a Pulitzer for them. The best songs are RICH GIRL, HOLLABACK GIRL, LUXURIOUS, and LONG WAY TO GO. Those are the only ones I can stand to listen to more than once every time I pop in the cd. BUBBLE POP ELECTRIC is a very stupid song.The most ANNOYING thing on this album had to be the fact that in almost every song, she mentions those Japanese minions she has following her around, the Harajuku Girls. She even has a song for them aptly titled HARAJUKU GIRLS. It was cute up to a point, but it really is annoying. Another annoying thing is that in HOLLABACK GIRL, she says s*** way too many times. It becomes overdone after about the tenth time.So, if you like Madonna-esque songs, then this album is for you. If not, steer clear from it and you will be one happy camper.",0

Too often we see a self-help title and think that's just for me. This book has a great first chapter. After that it's a collection of the same tired advise seen in every other self-help book out there. The authors are professional publishers who have little life experience it appears. An excellent example of where good writing cannot overcome an obvious simplistic and shallow understanding of the underlying issues. A complete waste of time. We threw the cassette in the trash can after the first ten minutes. Exceedingly repetitive and long-winded. The Sierra Club example really was simplistic and insulted our intelligence.

This sequel to Shanghai Noon is perhaps one of Jackie Chan's worst movies. The story is a cliche--Jackie has to rescue his sister and avenge his father's death. The twist in this story is that he has to go to England to find the killer. Of couse we have to put up with a lot of bad jokes about English food and stereotypical English gentlemen. I particularly hated the performance of Owen Wilson. I simply can't understand why he keeps getting cast as a comedian. He's definitely not funny at all. To make it worse, the character he plays has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Even Jackie Can is not at his best in this one. The fight scenes aren't as fluid as some of his other recent performances. His age really shows in his fight scenes. If you're craving a recent Jackie Chan film, you should stick with the Rush Hour series. I give this two stars instead of one out of goodwill for Jackie Chan.",0

"Just Works Great

After having great difficulty installing another Trendnet product - Wireless G router, I might have been doubly foolish to chance it once more time. Turns out this wireless adapter was a blessing in disguise. It was extremely easy to install with the included software. Another reviewer mentioned to use Windows to configure it. Simply, it does not work. Once I realize that the included software was the better choice, everything was fast and painless. On top of this, I now find that this wireless adapter is even slightly faster than my wired (cat5) network. I will see how it goes in the next several months. Otherwise, even for a slight increase in speed I might just get rid of all the wires and reclaim some of my living space.My concern was that I just wanted the device to work and not having to spend countless hours and workarounds.

I absolutley adored this memoir of Miles & Guislane Moreland's inspiring walk from sea to sea, Mediterrean to Atlantic across France. From the small bed & breakfast type inns to the larger hotels, the changing landscapes, and of course, the dogs(!) they encountered made for a far too quick of a read. I was enjoying their trip so much that I wanted their walk to go on for another 300+ miles! Makes one want to go on a walk as well, to the point of looking forward to blisters, afternoon exhaustion, and picnics of wine and cheese. And the insight gained by living a simpler, but far more satisfying life.",1
"THE MAH JONG PLAYER'S COMPANION. EXCELLENT!!

THE MAH JONG PLAYER'S COMPANION is an excellent book for beginners and beyond.All hands are shown in colour making it easy to understand as well as it is indexed so you can look up hands that can be made from tiles you have been dealt.It includes scoring and strategies on how to place your tiles so others don't predict your hand. It includes organising a tournament and answers questions to the rules of the game.The index is divided conveniently into RUNS, CHOWS, PAIRS, WINDS, DRAGONS, BAMBOO CHARACTER AND CIRCLE SUITS, and many more. I would highly recommend this book for new comers to Mah Jong.",1

"Good book

I enjoyed this book, because Colleen was a likeable character.

This book was a waste of money. It is more of a beginner's guide and tutorial than a reference book. Needs to add a reference section for all of the functions available in the formula editor.

"Completely dumb

I can't believe I paid $22 bucks for this ridiculous movie! The first 2 films in this slasher-franchise were entertaining; part 3 (I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer), however, is a complete waste of time and money. When you're done watching the movie you'll just feel like slapping the director and movie studio for putting such a crappy film out and just trying to capitalize/cash-in on the successful franchise (1st 2 movies).",0
"Dense and well-written

A very dense and beautifully written book that puts forth a systematic theology of the Spirit. Marshall covers all the major aspects of Christian theology (incarnation, the church, spiritual gifts, etc.) from a point of view of the Spirit. Her main thesis is that humans are active participants in the life of God through the power of the Spirit. She fleshes this out in very meaningful and rich ways. My critiques of the book would be some subtle gender bias and some unsubstantiated claims. For example, she says near the beginning of the book that Christians don't talk about the Spirit enough and that our theology is ""insufficiently Trinitarian,"" but so is hers, because she never once mentions ""Father"" in the book. But overall, Marshall is a very well-versed and well-read theologian, and her book is worth the time it takes to read it.",1

"It's only alive while Ravelstein is

In this faux memoir, Bellow gives us Abe Ravelstein, a fascinating, infuriating and ultimately delightful character. This is the book's problem. Being so much larger than life, Ravelstein's presence overwhelms all the other characters so that they totally disappear into the background. When Ravelstein dies, the book for all intents and purposes ends as an interesting read. It limps along with Chick's own brush with death which just feels tacked on. I am aware that this book has a basis in reality, but it just doesn't hold together well. The character that Bellow has created in Ravelstein; regardless of his origin, deserved better.",0

This book is another disappointment by a very talented author. The idea, it seems is taken from Homer Hickam's novel 'October Sky or The Coalwood Way.'

For years the film version of Carousel was out of print, but all that is changed now with this fabulous, newly remastered, CD containing not only all the material from the old CD but tons of additional material as well. With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRae, this is by far the best version ever of the Rodgers and Hammerstein masterpiece, easily topping the Broadway version and all revivals. Soliloquy is masterful as rendered by McRae, all of Jones' numbers are magic, the ensemble numbers are fine, and You'll Never Walk Alone has never been more moving.

Constantine is a very bad adaptation of the Comic book called Hellblazer and when I say bad, I do mean bad.

Keanu Reeves literally gives the worse performance of his career in this film and most of the actors around him follow his path.

At first I thought that, sense it was new, it just had to warm up. But to my dismay, every shot fired afterward turned out to be the same. After farther inspection, I found that the barrel was much to big, and because of this, the bb was bouncing around as it traveled through the shaft and therefore, sending it off track.

My only complaint is that the studio decided to cut half the tracks and replace them, which is what took them so long to get this one out. I have the ""advance"" copy of this one, and it is incredible. It's really too bad they switched out ""superman"" ""Would That Make U Love Me"" ""u center me"" and ""Spend the Night With Me"".

"I always enjoyed Arthur Lee and ""Love"" but...

This volume reads like something someone wrote as a literary disertation for some type of graduate work in music studies. It wasn't anything I could become interested in, because the bulk of the writer's narrative takes an exciting, groundbreaking recording and evaluates the music and lyrics in antisceptic, academic terms. What research in the way of first-hand interviews with band members or other methods of information-gathering for this project was unclear to me. Although the writer was able to string his thoughts into a coherent analysis, I was very disappointed with the overall content. It did not tell me anything about the album ""Forever Changes"" that I didn't already know or couldn't have imagined.",0

I have read almost everyone of Mitch Albom's books that are heartfelt. I think this was his first was this book and while this one isn't my favorite or as memorable as say One More Day or Have A Little Faith. These honest books get to the heart of matters and always make me cry at some point.This is a quick read not because it is just simply written but because I eagerly wanted to learn what was next. I love that the author always meets such interesting people to write about and they are such regular people, people you want to know.",1

"limits the light of judaism

the agadah of talmud as known is the deepest part of the talmud in its way and putting it in any sort of frame or summary needs lots of study in the deeper sections of torah like the kabalah etc. therefore for someone that truly has a idea in the great light it contains bialik limited it in a drastic way with many misquotes etc.after all deeper you understand in torah will bring you closer and enrich your connection to g_d and we saw the contrary from bialik and co.which brings us to the conclusion that many of his teachings were translated to his comfort and desire.",0

Apart from the pretty stunning 'Letter From An Occupant,' sung by Neko Case, this cd is uninteresting noise. NP have nothing on the Beach Boys.

Grab a copy of Neko Case's, 'Furnace Room Lullaby,' and sigh with relief.",0
"Monica Shannon's story of a boy who wants to be a sculptor.

This book for children is about a young boy living on a farm in Bulgaria in the 1920s or early 1930s. In a way it is a little unusual (at least it seemed that way to me) in that the first half of the book appeared to be written for 8 to 11 year-olds whereas the second half of the book, as the boy Dobry grows older and wishes to be a sculptor, seems to be written for an older child. But, the book won the 1935 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature, so I may be in the minority in my opinion.",0
"Not as advertised.

This is not a serial, nor was it produced in 1950. The Editorial Review is an accurate description of the disc, but that is at odds with the title header. So, buyer beware.",0
"clumsy and obvious

I found this book very depressing because the author is so obviously in love with his idea that he forgot to write a novel. I'm fascinated by the topic of religious people questioning their faith, so I would have been very interested in the first section if only there had been any real people involved. But there's no character development; there's just the author working out an idea with wooden puppets. And the irony, if that's what it is, of the doubting minister's grandson ending up in a cult is too clumsy and obvious for this book to deserve any respect.",0

"ON/OFF switch SPARKS!!! FIRE HAZARD!!!!

I wrote an earlier review giving this warmer 5 stars because it heated the bottles so fast and the cooler portion made it easy to use anywhere in the house and travel. BUT I noticed that the ON/OFF switch SPARKED EVERY TIME you turned it off.Luckily, I had kept the box so I just exchanged it for another only to discover the second did the exact same thing! This is a HUGE FIRE HAZARD! I have contacted The First Years about this problem but so far have not rec'vd a reply. I even searched for information about Recalls on this warmer but found nothing. Maybe it was just a fluke that I purchased the two out there that did this - but if I were you I wouldnt take the chance that there are more with this problem, avoiding it altogether and buy a different brand!Initially I would have recommended this warmer but now I say DONT BUY IT! The on/off switch needs to re-designed before it is safe to use. (I wouldn't be surprized if this gets recalled!)",0

OK, this movie is the worst, i dont know if it was just badwritting, bad acting, or both. probably both. Clooney is the worsetBatman to-date.

Batman and Robinhad NOTHING!Worset part was Silverstone, i swear, i got a cavityafter seeing this movie, she was way too sweet, made me wanna PUKE!The whole story-line was confusing and pointless.If there is aBatman 5, i sure hope the kill off Robin and Batgirl, and get KeatonBACK, HE was the GREATEST Batman of all time",0

"Great Product

Just the right consistency. Absorbs well, and cleared up my baby's dry skin eczema within days of use. Not a super pleasant scent, but then again, it's not scented: so that's the whole point.

The smell is kind of rubbery, but not very strong, and I don't smell it except when I am putting it on.",1
"Where are the opposing views?

I was greatly disappointed and even disgusted with this book. To begin with, my husband, siblings and many friends of my family is serving in Iraq, have recently returned or on their way back. Where is the voice of the ones that agree with the cause? (I know over fifty Marines, Airmen and Soldiers that find Moore offensive and despicable. One Navy Officer friend of mine wrote him a letter of condemnation, where is this?) I question the validity of the majority of these letters. Especially after having seen the Military personnel, Families of the dead and the Trooper who he used in Fahrenheit speaking out about his false representation of them in his film. Moore has disappointed me, yet again, with this bulk of self serving, money making, garbage.",0
"Propaganda for the Confederacy

I believe this entire film was made for the sole purpose of getting sympathy to the Cofederacy. Most of the story follows Stonewall Jackson and the story is way too drawn out. The only good part is the battle seens but they do not totally show the grusomeness of war. Anyone who promotes this crap must be a rebel. Creighton Lovelace should be arrested for treason in his idea of a returning Confederate States of America. Guess what, I am a Yankee and an American. You southerners need to stop all this Confederate flag debates and bumber stickers. You should be honoring the country you live and not try to destroy it. Leave the country or honor it. And this movie needs to be trashed.",0
"Deadly Detail!

This is a VERY detailed mask for what you pay. I have to admit i enjoy viewing it from a distance rather than wear it though. It looks amazing, i mean the picture does do it justice. It's a bit on the oversized side though. The main problem i had with it is the lack of air i was getting. I had to cut some larger nostrils, eye holes, and eye brow slits to make it more bareable. Its hard to wear for long periods just because of the airflow issues. I have it on display now and am still enjoying it deadly gaze on a daily basis. Good quality mask, slightly oversized, but overall im please with my purchase. 4 out of 5 stars!",1
"Well organized, informative, and entertaining.

The library wouldn't let me renew this book anymore, so I had to buy my own copy!As a novice gardener, I found this book to be just the thing to see me through my first growing season. As a librarian, I love the organization, the completeness of the index, and the thorough way all subjects are handled. There is a great section on herbs, too.As an avid reader, I enjoyed his occasional asides to the reader. For example, under ASPARGUS, STORING, the author tells us: ""You must be kidding. You don't store asparagus, you eat it!"" This is just what I wanted to be told, having eaten untold numbers of young asparagus spears with the mud still on 'em.A worthy purchase.",1

"MTV Plugged?

I'm a big fan of ""The Boss"", but for the life of me, can't fathom why he is unable to follow the lead of larger acts, and actually ""unplug"" for MTV Unplugged. This CD offers no new material that can't be found elsewhere, and is basically nothing more than a ""live in concert"" CD that just so happened to be filmed by MTV.This concert took place in 1992, and you know it's pretty bad when you have bands ribbing you three years later about going on MTV UNPlugged, and then having to go and plug in. It's not like Bruce doesn't know how to play acoustic guitar, because he does. I'm a big acoustic guitar fan, and for someone of Bruce's talent level, to not be able to write songs that can be played acoustically only serves to bring down the level of respect I have for his talent.Not what I would consider an essential recording, and not recommended, unless you are such a die-hard ""Boss"" fan that you have to own every album he puts out. Otherwise, save your money.",0

I like this bath pillow except for one thing. After having it for less than a year, it sprung a leak. The leak appears to be around the suction cup. These are so cheap, I'm taking a chance and ordering another one. It would cost more in my time and shipping to try and return for an exchange than to just order a new one.I don't like the terrycloth version that is available (this one is all plastic), because the terrycloth ones I've had tend to discolor and develop mold. This one got a little discolored on the back, but not badly, and it cleaned fairly easily. Up until the recent leak, I've been satisfied.",0

If you like simulation games and airports, this game is great. However, you had BETTER have a Pentium II processor with at least 200 MhZ.

After I got that taken care of, I discovered that the scrolling in the game was about as smooth as sandpaper, and hard to control the mouse. Luckily I also have a Pentium II computer, and it works fine there.I also found some data mix-ups with the populations of cities, I don't think Los Angeles only has 550,000 people! I also think that the pop. of 4,000,000 for Mexico City was a little off. As well as 30,000,000 for Miami.If you don't mind these kinds of problems, buy the game, it's great.

"beating a dead horse

Finally on DVD...but...I won't go into lengthy detail on the changes; since there are plenty reviews here that have already done the job for me.The digital ""enhancements"" stick out like a sore thumb of course, but other things bothered me as well. Star Wars was originally a feat of innovation, and relying on cgi effects is far from the brilliance Lucas and co. were once forced to conjure.I pay close attention to sound, and I noticed that sometimes the voice overdubs, mainly on Lea's, will sound crystal clear, and some of the other characters have that muffled, 70's film quality, which I don't mind a bit. I just say do them all over or don't do them at all.Also, pay close attention to the Millennium Falcon vs. Ti-Fighters and you can see flaws around some of the Ti-Fighters as they fly around Han and Luke.It's a DVD for chrissake!

"No gems left in the attic

As other reviewers have expressed rather eloquently, the Band is responsible for producing some of the finest music of the 20th century.All the evidence one needs for this assertion is provided in this fabulous package.However, as it has already been pointed out by previous reviewers, this box set is preaching to the choir. And, as a member of that choir, I contend that the book alone is worth the price. Also, the few live performances provided on the DVD were a most welcome surprise, as all of them were worthy performances showing the Band at the height of their powers.But, regarding the unreleased musical material, sadly, I don't feel that any of it is essential, as the best of it has already been included on the remastered original albums.So the attic has proved to be bare. No matter. Truely this box set is one of the finest you'll see. A fine tribute to five musicians who have left a musically legacy that will live on for the ages.",1

"Worthless, despite the high CR rating

I bought this as a gift because it had been rated highly by Consumer Reports. I was terribly disappointed. They look, feel, and perform like a child's toy. The eyepieces are tiny, so it's hard to even get them to line up with your eyes; the field of view is miniscule, the image is muddy and incredibly dim. We returned them and purchased a pair of Nikan Action 8x40 for a similar price, and were delighted.If you are considering these because of price, look at the Nikon Action 8x40 -- crisp and bright, and similarly priced. If you must have something pocket-sized, consider the Nikon Travelite V series. The image is nowhere near the Nikon Action 8x40 mentioned above, but it's still superior to this one. Also the eyepieces are much wider. Nevertheless for birding etc, I would hesitate to reccomend any of the pocket binoculars.

"want to read a bad sitcom?

Classic case of inventing a catchy, oh-so-cute title, then inventing a story to go with it. As usual, with painful results.

It is not even by the same authors who wrote the PBS book. I agree with some of the other reviewers, this sounds like a scam job at the expense of children and their parents. I may have kept the book if I wasn't so upset about being deceived. If you are looking for the PBS book it is called ""The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions"" by John & Danita Thomas. I have sent an email to the authors about this rip off book, I hope they take some type of action.",0
"Both humorous and informative

Indeed a very helpful and informative book for understanding Indonesian people and culture. Haveing spent almost two years living and working in Indonesia I found myself referring to this book often. I found myself explaining to my fellow expatriates why certain things happened the way they do in this country often referring to things I read. From conducting business to accomplishing everyday tasks, this book offers excellent example and explantions. Definately a book for expatraites living in Indonesia, business travellers, but also beneficial to the traveller wanting to ascertain a deeper, more sincere understanding of Indonesian people and culture.",1
"Excellent Resource!

This is an excellent book with many great suggestions on how to deeply connect with people.Even though I've always been blessed to be able to connect and converse with people easily and already practice many of the skills suggested in this book, I still learned many new ways to connect even more fully.I would highly recommend this book, especially if connecting with others doesn't come quite as naturally.",1

"Woah, not much to say, it's as bad as you would fear and then some

I'm surprised Bo only co-wrote/wrote two songs on the album itself though; since he's supposedly the ""real experienced rocker"" type I would've expected more. Seems like his material was mostly relegated to the dual disc, either because it's not commercial enough or not good enough or both.After listening to the 2 tunes (which on this album of subpar pop ), it's clear that they are not good enough as single material. Hope this pop cliche avenue bodes well for the powers that be behind this commercialization of Bo Bice. I ain't buying the next CD until I Hear all of the audio clips, Now that is the REAL deal!",0
"Defective out of the box

Hooked it up and it leaked water out of the bottom. Called Keurig who did not seem surprised by the problem. They said they would ship a new one out along with a prepaid fedex shipping label to send the old one back ""for testing to see why this happened."" Right. Keurig needs to get it together. Pretty inexcusable. If you can find a comparable coffee maker, I would buy it over keurig.",0
"Just Stopped Working One Day

Suddenly, after 16 months of use, the phone just stopped working. Neither the handset nor the speaker phone works and the LCD display has gone blank (but the LEDs light-up). I called the customer support line and they recognized the problem. But they will not replace or fix the phone without charging me ... since the one-year warranty period ran out four months ago. Obviously I am not going to pay ... for a refurbised phone, especially since I was never really happy with it. Its duplex feature never quite worked well and the mic was not sensitive enough and the speaker volume never went high enough.

it's true this stuff gets the animal smell out, but it leaves behind the odor of the product which is not all that great.

She promised to have the customer service staff call me back- NEVER HAPPENED. I have sent several emails as directed on their voicemail- NEVER RESPONDED.

"True, not the most useful accessory but.....

I must agree that this charger stand is not the most useful accessory for this phone. I must say however, Nokia does not claim this is a two-slot charger. Also,it is important to note that the plug DOES fit into the stand albeit - snugly. Make sure that the plug going into the stand is the right end - notice that the transformer has a ""wing"" shaped slot for the larger end of the cord. If you try to put the wrong side - the ""wing"" shaped end-into the charger it will not fit. This stand is not so useful because the charger plug is so simple to begin with. Save your money and buy a buy a case for this phone instead - it scratches too easily.",0

"Ooh Madalena by Elis Regina, the master

When Ella Fitzgerald came to Rio de Janeiro in 1971, she got impressed by a track she listened to from a cassette tape someone had presented her. It was the smash hit of the moment - ""Madalena"" by composer Ivan Lins as sung by Elis Regina. It was 1971 and Ella has recorded it live in 1972 in her Jazz the Philharmonica concert at the Santa Monica Civic. The master Elis Regina counted on the great Chiquinho de Morais as her arranger for this album. Another smash hit from this album was Marcos Valle's ""Black is Beautiful"".",1

"Great Customer Service, Terrible Product

I have used nothing but Norelco for 15-20 years. Great shavers.I bought the 7180 last November. The battery gave out 2-3 months later (no, I did not overcharge). They sent a new shaver. About 1 month later, I was tapping the razor on the sink to shake out the shavings and the battery (I assume) was knocked out of position. The shaver stopped working. They sent a new one. About 1 month later, the shaver just stopped working for no known reason. They sent a new one. The new one has worked 6+ months. This week, it just stopped working.Up until now, I have had nothing but great experiences with Norelco. I'm sure if I asked for a new razor, they'd give me one. I'm just tired of having them break. I don't think I was abusive to these shavers.",0

I've been struggling with a wireless connection for about a year because there's no phone jack in the room where my computer is. I have DSL in another room with a wireless router plugged into it. I had a Belkin wireless card that needed the drivers installed almost monthly. I was a little hesitant about this product because it seemed too good to be true. The only computer product easier to use than the XE102 is a mouse. You need two of these things. Plug one in by your router, and connect a cat-5 cable between your router and the XE102. Go to your computer room, plug the other XE102 into the wall socket, and run another cat-5 cable to your computer. Windows recognizes the connection after about 5 seconds. That's all there is to it; didn't have to do anything with the router, internet settings, no software to install, nothing to do with the XE102 except plug them in. Awesome product, I wish I could give it 6 stars.",1

Its low-budget, cult nature seems to preclude it from being mentioned in the same collective breath as such widely-acknowledged Film Noir masterworks as Laura and Touch of Evil, but Raw Deal is definitely one of the greats.

Ok, I like this album. Well, I like more than half of it. As has been said, don't even bother comparing this record to other ministry releases unless you have an overdeveloped sense of irony.

"What a horrible book!

This was selected to be read for our book club. First, it is not available as an e-book, so I had to buy the actual book. What a waste. The story itself is terrible. Nothing is fleshed out. This would be one of those stories that could be placed in installments in a magazine. The premise is also way out there. The author introduces things, but then lets them drop. For example - the police officer finds information from years past that somewhat 'predicts' what happens in the future. That's it. It goes nowhere else. Do not waste your money on this book. It is terrible.",0

What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time.

"Better as a Historical Story

I enjoyed reading the Alienist, but I wouldn't describe it as a ""mystery"" or even a ""thriller."" It is an extremely well-written story of turn-of-the-century New York -- a story which centres around a murder investigation. I found the historical aspects of the story the most interesting, as Caleb Carr's detailed descriptions bring to life the city, people's attitudes and other aspects of life 100 years ago. No surprise, as the liner notes state that he was educated as a historian, and is a native New Yorker.As for the murder investigation, although it's interesting, it's not a ""page turner"" story. It is a very intellectual story with bits and pieces of action. Caleb Carr doesn't manage to convey the drama of the action quite as well as he conveys the historical aspects of the story. And I found the conclusion of the story unsatisfying.I agree entirely with the 4/5 rating this book gets (to date) -- 5 for the historical part of the story, 3 for the murder investigation.",1

It was his money that bailed her out and tried to clean up this mess for the next 7 years before he literally ran for his own emotional life (instead of kill himself like Wayne did). Her partner who shot himself (and was supposedly the victimizer) can't speak for himself to rebut DeAnne's allegations. Ms. Nelson needs to do a little better job of screening her interview subjects. In my opinion, Ms. Nelson's credibility has been seriously compromised.",0

yes, I had the same problem as others. After using the cassette adaptor for a month or so, it would try to flip the cassette over to ""side b"" when I was making left turns. Interesting but really irritating. Then it began doing it all of the time & my car spit the cassette out wtih the messaage ""error."" They have said they will replace it --we'll see.

I happened across a United States Three show in Chicago last year. I loved the band and purchased this record. Le temps de tempo quickly became one of my all time favorites. I listen to it almost everyday. If you like pop music you'll love this. le temps du tempo is also an amazing ""headphone"" record -- there is some crazy stuff buried in there if you listen closely. If you like the Goo Goo dolls, Sloan, Velvet Underground, then you need to add this to your collection.",1

"Didn't like it then.......

and I don't like it now. It is painful for me to say this because I am a huge EPMD fan but this album is horrible. This came out in 94'?!?!?!?! Look at the other albums that came out that year. Nas' Illmatic, Snoop's first joint, Outkast's first joint, etc. The point is some hot albums came out this year and PMD coming from his background should have fallen right in line with the hotness of that year. The lyrics are weak along with the beats. I thought maybe it was my mental state back then on why I didn't like this release. But I got the same feeling when I listened to it today. This album has no replay value what so ever. Amazingly, the second solo release from PMD is DOPE!!!!!",0
"BANG, ZOOM! I WISH THEY'D JUST STAY ON THE MOON!

I am probably one of the few people on earth who hates the Honeymooners. To me, it was a tiresome cliche that was overextended. The lines people call classic are tired and got old fast. The worst of the mix was the dreaded ""hommina."" It sounded like a rude noise and was highly irritating.The characters were cliche, cardboard cutouts. Ralphie Boy was a loudmouthed windbag, Alice was a sassy brat, Trixie was a sniveling, driveling dish rag and Norton was just plain annoying. He was like a mosquito you want to swat.""The Honeymooners"" was full of chauvinism and cliches. It just wasn't funny. The show was predictable and most of all, it was boring. I really don't like ""The Honeymooners.""",0

To say I was highly dissapointed with this DVD would be an understatement. The wrestling is great, don't get me wrong. The quality of the DVD (it skips and acts funny in places) is awful, and they cut several of the matches.

"Can you say, ""BOOOOOORING?!!!""

I used to LOVE John Grisham, but I found this book extremely boring and yet the perfect book to bore me right to sleep every night. I only needed to read one page each night before I was out. I can understand his other books centered around Christmas and family life being more sensitive and about feelings and stuff, but when the title comes right out and says, "" The Last Juror"" and there's a picture of a Jury table on the front cover I expect it to be as fast-paced and exciting as all of his other law books. I was very dissapointed. The summary on the inside flaps actually built it up that way, which is why I forked over the money to buy it. But, like many movie trailers, most all of the exciting parts were in the summary and the book, for the most part dragged and dragged. If you are looking for a typical fast-paced John Grisham book do not get The Last Juror. You will be highly dissapointed!",0
"Worthless product - unresponsive seller

I should have listened to other reviewers that this was a shoddy product. It broke after only a couple hours (cumulative) of very light use.It is also constructed so that you cannot even attempt to do your own repairs or troubleshooting to see what the problem might be. There is not a manual. It came with nothing more than one page that told how to connect the handle, etc. That was it.That leaves me stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm out over $100, I don't have a floor buffer and the seller will not return my email asking to discuss replacement or reimbursement.",0

While the book has some great quotes and stories of individuals dissatisfied with their jobs (many of which I could relate), the layout of the book is hodge-podge.

"Delghtful to viddy.

This book is a modern classic. At first, it was almost imossible to understand because of the made up language of ""nadsat"" used by the narrator (Alex.) Once you got past this barrior (on the second read for me) it became a major plus for the book, giving you a sense of belonging to the futuristic, yet all to similar (if extreme) society. It also explores the dangers of conditioning, reminiscant to Aldolis Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" and it shows one possibility for our society in the not so distant future",1

"Sharp, Comfortable, Good Battery Life

When I lost the recharging unit to my B&D; grass shear, I was already so dissatisfied that I decided to try the American Gardener 4-inch cordless. It's hard to believe that there can be such a big difference between two products. The American Gardener (AG)sheer is twice as sharp and twice as fast as the B&D.; It will even cut through mondo grass and other tough stemmed plants. It is great for trimming spring growth from bushes, and even helped shape a tangelo tree and three privets.The battery life - considering the speed - a remarkable 45-50 minutes and if that isn't tghe kicker, the AG is comfortable, lighter and seemingly more ergonomic than the B&D.;Even though there is no way to lock these shears (or any others) in an ""on"" position, it still deserves five stars. I'd give it more if I could liock it in an on position. Of course, I'd probably forget to turn it off and then they'd start calling me ""Lefty.""",1
"2.5 stars

After folding in 1984 Camel made a return in 1992 with this recording. Unfortunately, it is not much of an improvement on 84's Stationary Traveler. As with S.T. production spoils this outing. The drums and keyboards in particular sound dated. The drums are too loud in the mix and are further spoiled with a too liberal use of echo. The keyboards rely too much on a tacky sounding electric piano. Latimer also fails to play with his usual brilliant flair. The songs are not particularly interesting and Susan Hoover's lyrics (which are typically quite good) give way to overused cliche (""we need you so""?). It's a shame as Latimer and company are capable of much better. Things improved some (but not dramatically) with 1997's Harbour of Tears. It was not until 1999's Rajaz that they truly returned to form. Rajaz is an inspired and complete effort. This recording, Dust and Dreams, unfortunately is not...Simon",0

"Barely A Summertime Beach Read

In retrospect, I should have expected this book to be as poorly written as it is. In the course of 300 pages, Professor Geisst attempts to provide the history of approximately 17 banking houses --- which translate into about 18 pages per house. (As a comparison -- Ron Chernow dedicated over 700 pages to the Morgan dynasty in his book. Imagine trying to condense that down into 18 pages). To call such treatments superficial is an understatement. Additionally, the book suffers from organizational flaws, particularly toward the beginning of the work. One even wonders if significant portions of The Last Partnerships were merely taken from Geisst's earlier work, Wall Street: A History, and shuffled around to create a new book.",0
"Only a great choice if you like alot of action and no story.

He usually doesn't pick bad scripts.Boy was I wrong. Without much meaningful dialogue, it was very hard to follow this movie. I did watch it to the end just to give the movie a fair shake. But even at the ending credits I was just left scratching my head. I didn't like Cowboys & Aliens either but at least I could follow the movie.If you're looking for another aliens vs humans aka Independence Day-style, look elsewhere.",0

There are a couple of really great trad tracks in here, but there is a lot of sheer crap, albeit by recognized performers from a variety of genres. Richard Thompson's Mingulay Boat Song is excellent, the scurrilous Good Ship Venus sung by Loudon Wainwright III is almost as raucous as the version I learned, and delivered in a simple melodic style. SAMPLE the tracks first, or you will be scratching your head, these are all over the sea lanes, with a few hanging out in the trees somewhere inland. I was impressed that Sting was doing some of these, his style is a bit overproduced (the presence of soft choral backup vocals with harmonies in major thirds!) but the main melodic line is generally straightforward, at least; much more authentic job on main line of Blood Red Roses than on Shallow Brown.

This book was excellent! I couldn't put it down. The writing is top notch, the plot is full of great twists. I see from reading the reviews that a lot of Christians are offended. That's to be expected. The fact of the matter is, Christianity has always concealed things and has always borrowed from other, older religions. To say that Mr. Brown's facts are wrong because they are not supported by the bible assumes that ones believes the bible to be the end all, be all, which many people do not.

For those who don't know the story of the curate's egg, basically the conclusion is that ""it's good in parts"".I read this book as a young Christian, and although I appreciated the mixture of scripture and anecdote, eventually the book became stilted - especially when it started to say that the RC's were ""unconstitutional"" (I'm not from the US).The all time best line comes in either chapter one or two. It is so funny and out of date that I can remember it by rote.""If the United States were to become Roman Catholic, the result, undoutedly, would be the conquest of this nation and the rest of the world by Russian Communism"".Don't get me wrong, I think the RC church is fatally flawed and unbiblical - but linking Commies and Catholics is not only unwarranted, but hysterical.

Might as well put a nail in the wall and dry plaster over it if you want to be sure. Otherwise, you may find wall hangings permanently damaged.",0
"Greatest album in a while...

I first heard of Josh Kelley in July when I was volunteering at a summer camp. We'd play his song ""Amazing"" in the Dining Hall between meals. When I got home, all of a sudden ""Amazing"" was all over the radio!!! So I bought his CD,and to my surprise, I ADORE IT!!!! Every song is excellent, he has a laid-back kind of sound. I'd reccommend his CD if you enjoy: John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, Jason Mraz, Counting Crows, maybe even a little Dave.",1

"U2 at their worst!

I have been a fan of U2 since the beggining. I enjoyed their previous change of direction with the last few albums, but this is just too much. I enjoyed three tracks on the album, and one more might grow on me. As I listened to the album I thought of someone running through a field of dandelions on a warm summer day, AND THATS WHEN I WANTED TO PUKE! Save your money. Buy something you have never heard before. Anything but this (...) from a great band, that has lost its edge(not the Edge of course).",0
"Very Nice, Excellent value

I also ordered these to get away from the problems with the wooden brushes. It's an excellent value and a very nice brush. Long handle like it's wooden counterpart, gives plenty of reach. Nylon bristels are just right, might be too stiff for a woman. The nylon doesn't lather as well as a natural bristle either, but will certainly last a lot longer. If I ever have to replace it ... I'd definitly get the Feng Shui again. Recommended",1

AT first it took longer and longer for the sound to come back on after powering it down. Then one day it quit working. It seems this is problematic with this device.

"5 star lemmings, crimeny!

My kindergartener has a better grasp of the revealed word of God and definitely has shown flashes of better writing than the authors of Left Behind. All of these 5 star ratings make me ashamed to be a Christian. Why? Because the book is a lousy piece of fiction. I can only assume the high ratings are the result of the lemming behavior typical of the brainwashed victims of fundamentalist cultdom. Life is short - don't waste any of it on this book.",0

"Held together with glue

Patchy, derivative, unoriginal. How exactly is this an album of original music -- it's sample mania, from sounds to vocals to grooves. He lifts entire pieces from Kronos Quartet, ferchrissake. If cheesy Eurodiva vocals are your thing (I guess he couldn't get Bjork but didn't mind finding someone who imitates her), you'll be in heaven here. In terms of originality and composition it isn't all that much better than stuff being produced by a slew of bedroom musicians across the world using Cubase or ProTools on their PCs. You can hear stuff as good or better on mp3.com any time. On the plus side, it's well produced and he gets decent synth sounds. Oakenfold is enormously popular and not about to go away -- like most bubblegum, when it catches, it's hard to get rid of.",0

Btw, it is always good to check the gapping of these spark plugs before installing them. According to my gap gauge, These are not pre-gapped. Another thing to do is to stay away from those gap gauge coins. They can damage your precious metal.Be careful with these!I love them!!!",1

"The motor died quickly

I gave it two stars instead of one because I though they made a decent fountain for the price. It wasn't noisy when I had it on the middle pump setting. Also, when positioned just right, it looked less cheap and flimsy.However, it's a little annoying to put together and a bunch of the rocks fall through to the bottom.If that was all I would have gave it three or possibly four for being decent while under $20. However, when the motor just flat out died in less than four weeks of only using it three hours a day, I got completely annoyed by the thing.I think they should have at least made the motor better.",0

If I were Sam Elliott, I would have this one pulled and destroyed. This is the worst movie I have ever watched. It has been re-mastered or something.

"Great read!

A slow start, but it still held my interest due to the characterization and how well written it is. Not really a sword and sorcery fantasy tale, and not a grand epic(I mean that in a good way- it's a more personal tale and it is wrapped up very completely in this novel). The protagonist, Cazaril, is an interesting and complex character, but definitely not an invicible warrior. I empathized with Caz throughout his journey, and enjoyed the philosophical and theological struggles that accompany his many challenges.If you've liked other books by this author, you'll probably like this one a lot. A better tale than her prior fantasy novel ""The Spirit Ring"", imho.Fun, compelling, and thoroughly enjoyable.",1

Whilst some parts are catchy, the ""one little two little three little idiots"" part on ""dog and his master"" is very cathcy, but u never seem to get the whole song in your head. the albumn is also very short 35 mins is not a great deal of time for an albumn so this is a little disappointing i would recomend this albumn to only those who love both ""st joe"" and ""sex and candy"" but dont get your hopes up, borrow first",0
"A terrible, disjointed, mess

What a mess of a book. I really wanted to like this one, and it comes with many high regards from the food world (and outside as well)... I have no idea why. It is a jumbled mess of disjointed accounts that would make far better individual newspaper or magazine shorts, which I would not be surprised if that was the original intention that somehow spawned into a book. From weak accounts of life inside Babbo which centered inexplicably on individuals with no importance rather than on the cooking/experiences to jumpy tales of the author's time in Italy which don't flow or develop into much of anything. I'm not sure how or why this book has managed such high ratings for what it is, there are much better accounts of kitchen life and even of kitchen life from an outsiders perspective. Pass on the hype, this is not worth the effort.",0
"Still going

I've been running my Clie now for several years and have yet to have any of the major problems others complain about. I do occasionally have to do a hard reset but that's only when I'm surfing the internet and hit a page that's far more complex than my browser can handle.The only major drawback I've run into with this PDA is the battery life. It starts off ok when you first get it but over time, it takes longer to recharge and delivers much less power per charge. When I first got it, I had no problem running the mp3 player for an hour or two. Two months ago I was lucky if I could run more than three songs before it drained out.But there's always hope. You can buy replacement batteries online pretty cheap these days and they last a whole lot longer than the one that comes installed.Decent memory, expandable memory sticks, good set of onboard software and I LOVE the little jog dial. Just watch out for that battery life.",1
"waste of time and money

Mr. Sparks should be offended this movie carries the name of his book but resembles nothing of it. I wasn't impressed with the book, either, but the way the movie just took an idea or two out of the book and left anything even remotely good out of it is just plain wrong. ""Based on the novel"" is saying it in the loosest of terms.Acting is downright horrible, and the essence of the characters from the book is completely missing. Modernizing the story probably did more harm than good to the movie, as the story is about the simplicity and the power of love, which can't be portrayed with today's problems of the youth.Simply put, it is a bad movie, and that's two hours of my life I will never get back.",0

"Doesn't work after only 6 months!

We bought this for the nursery and it worked pretty well until just this week. For no reason, it now just shuts off the sound randomly whenever it feels like it. Really unreliable when our baby doesn't sleep well without white noise. And it's not like we can sneak into his room to turn it back on without fully waking him up. We started using this thing back in April or May of 2012 and it's only the end of November!Another annoying thing is the the time on the LED screen is super hard to read unless you are the perfect angle. So you basically can only read it if you are standing up or sitting down in the rocker, not both. The screen is also a bit too bright when you are trying to keep the room dark.Other than that, the number of sounds is nice and it's fairly small/light enough to travel with, although the batteries die after 2-3 nights of use.",0

"A SNORE FESTIVAL FROM GREAT BRITIAN.

""Oklahoma!"" is as close to a perfect American Musical as you're ever going to find; and all this production did was make me appreciate the 1955 film version all the more. Trevor Nunn's pacing is slow to the point of boredom and the sporadic use of a ""live"" audience intercut with dead-air studio footage is distracting to say the least. All this makes it very hard to listen to the participants in the ""Making Of"" documentary on Disc 2 wax eloquently about how this 1999 production is better than the original Broadway version! I love ""Oklahoma"" and was genuinely excited about buying this DVD. I really was looking forward to a fresh new version of this Great American Romp. What I got was a museum piece pressed under glass like rose petals.",0

"Fun

Ok. I can't tell whether the Invisble Maniac is intentionally cheesy or not. It is clear the film makers are poking fun at themselves and other ""B"" films, namely slasher movies, but this film is funny either way, simply because of the overacting and horrible special effects. But if you are looking into renting or purchasing this movie, overacting and horrible special effects should be exactly what you expect.If you're a fan of Troma films then you know what to expect.

"Alot of great features for planning your fitness program

Vivonics Fitness Planner has alot of features that are really a pleasure to discover. One thing that I think is outstanding is the way it shows anything that you have eaten too much of in red. That's great...but even better, when you click on it, you are shown which of the foods contain it and how much from most to least. Since I teach dance, I do notice that it is hard to find fitness information that includes dance as an exercise. Dancers are very fitness conscious and it should be included in more books and programs. I do doubt that there is a better Fitness planning program than this one. It is very easy to locate foods and nutrients, etc. I am still learning to use it...but it isn't difficult at all. I really do recommend it.",1

UNFORTUNATELY I bought this book on a whim. The subject matter AND the book jacket reminded me of the mill village that I lived in as a child in North Carolina. Both of my parents' families were textile mill workers during (and after) the Great Depression. I found the prose to be poorly crafted and the book to be poorly edited--if it was edited at all. If you are looking for the experience of living in a mill village, this book is not going to invoke that feeling. It will only leave you feeling frustrated.",0

"Nothing Much New Here

The author does a nice job recounting Schmidt's career -- that is to say, his research was good. That being said, there's a temptation when someone writes about his boyhood hero (and the author expresses his admiration for Schmidt in the introduction) to put the subject on a pedestal no matter what, to apologize for perceived problems, or, worse, both. Unfortunately, the author falls victim to both temptations, and the book suffers because of it. The book will serve those who don't know much about Schmidt fairly well. For those who know more about him, you won't learn much that is new. The book also lacks meaningful analysis about Schmidt's career. In summary, I expected more on this subject and from this author, and I was disappointed.",0

Oh dear. this is an abysmal movie. So abysmal that after twenty minutes I found myself fast-forwarding through the movie, admittedly pausing to view the dirty bits involving Madonna and Defoe.

This film has a lot of good solid science in it. But it also has more than its share of nutty pseudo science.Give it 2 stars.If you are interested in a film of this type, I`d recommend ""How The Earth Was Made"".",0
"Boring, Boring, Boring

I tried to get through another one of Alexandra Robbins books, ""Quarterlife Crisis"", and it was a ridiculously slow read, as is ""Pledged."" I bought the book interested on reading about sorority life, as I was never in a sorority. I hoped this book would be interesting. I could only read this book in short sputs and get bored with the drama of it all. The girls lives got confusing, I kept getting all their names and drama mixed up. They were boring, too. It never kept my interest, and I swear I'll never read another book of Alexandra Robbins again. A waste of my time and money. I don't feel like I have gained anything from reading this book.",0
"False advertisement

Do not waste your money on this item. It states that you will receive three different rings and that's a lie. I got mine in the mail today and opened the box and all three were the same. I was disappointed even though it's only five dollars which is still a deal. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one. I haven't tried them out yet so I can't say anything about that part. But the material looks very cheap and the ring itself is small so I'll probably have to cut it down some so that my boyfriend can put it on. Bottom line is that it's false advertisement. Next time I'll just go with Doc Johnson and spend a few extra dollars.",0
"Nice looking on line, but too big

I ordered the watch on line, and since there were no dimensions listed, or alternate views of the product, I was not able to tell how ridiculously thick the watch face really is. It's a nice looking watch, too bad it is so clunky and weird looking. I had to return it and try another model. I did try the indiglo button when I first got it, and the illumination was very weak. Nothing like other Timex watches I've owned in the past. Very disappointed in it.",0
"Extremely absorbing, multi-faceted game

This will be a very brief review, but I just wanted to say I've been playing this game for 6 months straight and haven't gotten bored of it, and look forward to playing it on a near-daily basis.There are so many facets to the game. If you get tired of game-play, there's the building aspect. If get tired of building, you can learn how to make custom content. And then when you're done with that, it's time to install a new expansion pack and play the game with new challenges. There is a HUGE online fan base with TONS of custom content, so you can go ""shopping"" for days.The one caveat is to make sure your system can handle it. I'd recommend an nVidia geForce 6600GT card; 1 Gig of RAM, and a P4 3.0 GHz processor. With this configuration you can run the game smoothly with little lag, and all graphic options on high. You'll still enjoy the game with lower specs, but after you get addicted, you'll want to see the Sims in all their glory.",1
"Excellent keyboard

I love this keyboard! It has a feather-light touch which seems to make me type faster.The only problem I have had is making the connection between my mac and the keyboard. I recently took my keyboard with me for a big project (that's how much I like it) and when I returned it took about an hour of trying everything possible to re-connect. Once connected there were no other problems.",1
"One of the best BET Movies

"What a wonderful read!

I am not much on romance novels, so I was a bit leery about ordering this. But, it is a decision I have not regretted. I thought the author made great use of the way that God works in our lives, many times of which we are unaware. I never have believed in coincidences, so it was no coincidence when Timothy walked into that fateful night and had Beth as his waitress. I mean, after all, she wasn't even supposed to work that night. I loved this book, and would recommend it for everyone, romance lovers or not.",1
"Brilliant!

The specificity of the music references, the accuracy of the slang and the poignancy of words unsaid, the feel of a place and time delivered as if by sense transmission, the roots and rise of the crack epidemic, the escape from the confusion and loneliness of adolescence into worlds of superheroes - ""Fortress of Solitude"" delivers on so many levels at once that I found myself backing up and listening again over and over to my favorite parts trying to gather it all in. This is a masterful piece of fiction that I know I will return to.The Fortress of Solitude",1
"A good buy

It is full of detailed drawings of armor and weapons so in case you wish to know what something looks like without having to search all over the place for it, this book is worth it. It does not have a large amount of text explaining the weapons and armor though.",1
"Read it because it's inspiring

I'm not a diabetic, just intensely interested in nutrition and the workings of the human body. The author really does make an effort to put into plain-speak what he discovered about his body, and how the coma changed his life. I've recommended this book to so many people. Why won't a major publisher pick this up and give it the marketing it deserves? Also, are there published doctor-rebuttals of the claims put forth here?",1
"Very negative views of Key West

I bought this book for a trip to Key West. I had high expectations based on the reviews. I got the impression that Ms. Keith hates Key West! I had several guide books and ended up putting this one on the shelf because every review seemed to have a negative or snarky comment. Several reviewers call her ""witty"" but I just thought she came across as negative. I didn't read the other chapters, maybe she likes the other keys better! I found Hidden Florida Keys and Everglades: Including Key Largo and Key West very helpful.",0
"Great resource for future teachers or parents!

This book is written very well and is very informative. I found this book to be a great tool for teachers. I read this book for a class and I felt that it kept my interest and made for easy reading material. This book provides parents and/or teachers with insight on how to help children learn to read. This book also includes many great activities and strategies to use to strengthen and encourage literacy (no matter what age the student is). I have tested many of the activities on students myself, and found that it made teaching and learning to read more enjoyable for everyone involved. Overall, I thought this book was great. I plan on keeping it as a resource in my classroom or even in my own home.",1
"Where did the funny go?

My husband and I were so dissapointed with the movie. It cleared up one storyline, but it wasn't well written. Where did the funny go? If you are a fan of the series - yes, watch the movie. Just go in with low expectations. It is nice to see the characters again - even though for some reason they set Daisy's character back to being super shallow.",0

"NewsWeek has ruined their Magazine

NewsWeek used to be the best weekly news magazine. I have been a subscriber for 35 consecutive years. I used to read it to get the inside stories about what is happening in the news. Since they changed it 9 months ago it is now only editorial opinions about things I couldn't care less about. I only keep reading it now because I already have a paid subscription for it. I will not renew my subscription when it runs out in March, I have never paid more then $23.00 per year to subscribe. I got a renewal notice for $42.00. I wouldn't pay that much even if the magazine was still good. They must want to go out of business.",0

"cheap and CHEAP

This coat seemed like a great deal but once I received it I see why it is so cheap. The zipper is crummy and the side pocket zipper pull broke off when I went to zip one of them open. The feel of the jacket is also CHEAP and the removable faux fur hood embellishment looks like rat fur and it also looks like it is coming off the huge hood. It could be cute if the hood had a better design and the fur was nicer, fix those zippers and get some nicer feeling fabric and it could be a winner! Close but no cigar....",0

"Worthwhile Read

Others have ripped the editing of this book and I'd have to agree. However, the poor editing does give the book a certain raw charm. Overall, i found the book to be very informative and I often find myself going back to the book to look up this or that fact. I've found it very helpful as a new fan of this music. In particular, the american hardcore discography at the end of the book is quite useful. One other thing that blows about this book is the lack of an index. Having said all that though, the bottom line is I haven't found anything else on the market that even compares to what Mr. Blush has put out. Thanks for putting this together! It's really quite impressive and definitely worth every penny.",1

"Warning for average buyers

The setup unstructions for this amplifier are so unclear they are indecipherable. I am not an audiophile, but over many years I have hooked together preamps, turntables. tape decks, DVDs, TVS, with an amplifier, speakers and subwoofers. I have managed fine getting my computers up and running. But this bear of an amplifier has me frustrated and angry. The manual is absolutely the worst set of instructions I have ever read for anything. It is obvious Sony never pretested their manual setup directions on average buyers. I read one warning about this, but was confident I would do ok. Now I regret buying this amp wasting hours getting it right.",0

I am sure this stuff works great, but I can't get it to go down. They grainy, gel-fluid makes me gag every time. I have tried a variety of flavors and they all have the same effect.

"Tummy fun

My daughter has really enjoyed this mat. In the beginning she would just sort of check out the fish(she looooves fish), but over time her ability to interact with it has greatly increased. Now-4mnths- she pushes around on the fish with great joy even making fun bubbles. It is a great first tummy time toy. The pillow velcros on so you can remove it if your little one wants to practice holding themselves up or just for a wash. As far as the new water everyday thing goes. I was good about that in the beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something. It turns out nothing horrible will happen if you don't change it very often. Actually the ability to empty it is helpful if you plan on taking it with to say grandma's house. Very easy to roll up and take with unlike our playmat. The little sun could be easier to activate bubble noise. A little hard for the little bitty ones. Toys are still good for crinkling and chewing though.",1
"Pass this book up.........its almost as worse as the third.

When I picked up this book, I thought it would be about a new ship that was once again exploring the Genesis planets like in Star Trek III. However, I was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.It is yet ANOTHER novel that is not needed for this story. There should have been only 2 books in this storyline. Once Maltz and Carol Marcus were gone (I'm not even going to whine about Saavik not being in this story!), then it should have ended nicely.This novel seems very forced! ""Let's mix in all the characters that were introduced in the earlier books, so we can call it Genesis!"" There is NO EXCITEMENT and NO INTERESTING SUBPLOTS. I skipped through most of the story to only see how Picard's team handled this new adventure.Save your money, folks! Discover the relaunch of Deep Space Nine and Voyager instead!",0
"Amazing document of its time

It's amazing how much people wrote off the Krokers when this was published but also how prescient they have been proven to be since the publication of their trilogy Data Trash (Kroker and Weinstein), Hacking the Future, and Digital Delirium. No one else writing in the era was even close to as bang-on in their analysis, and although the three works can be difficult at times, they remain the top of the pile among the literature - but academic and popular - of that era in this subject.",1

While entertaining I love having music playing softly in the background, however, with a big flat screen plasma TV hanging on the wall I wanted video to go with the music.

"Bogs Down After a Good Start

The first 50 pages or so are indeed laugh-out-loud funny. The next 50 are okay. But then it really bogs down, goes around in circles, starts repeating itself, and just gets dumber and lamer.

"Very cheap way to get a classic story

Peter Rabbit is a classic primarily because of its illustrations, and on that most important point, this Dalmatian Press edition fails.The color on the illustrations is over-saturated. The paintings look dark, ""wet"" and blurry. Perhaps the latter is a result of too much enlargement.Thin covers and stapled binding in the great tradition of Scholastic. (sarcasm intended)Still, this cost a buck. (Wonder if it came from the Dollar Spot at Target?) And it does provide a fuller telling of the story than some truncated editions (such asWhere's Peter Rabbit?: A Lift-the-Flap Book (Lift the Flap)). That means your child will enjoy such gems as:""Don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden. Your father had an accident there. He was put in a pie."" (!!!)",0

There is no cohesive plot, but one is hardly missed with such poetic vignettes to take its place. WARNING: This is NOT Science Fiction.",1

"It's woo woo, pure and simple

any one who claims to know the word of God, but denies the deity of Christ, or claim that his dying for us was useless, and so on, and claims that ""we really don't need Jesus, he was nothing special"" is denying the Bible which is the word of God. There are no ""special lost books"" or ""secret codes"" sure there are! But, alas, it does not come from God, Christ Jesus. Angels don't probe people, abuse them, or come as ugly horrific creatures. They don't mutilate cattle, either. Good=good, Evil=Evil. There are no UFOs. There ARE things underground, however, and make friends with guys who believe stuff like ""Men who stare at Goats"" even our own church is buying this crap, and disguising it as the Word of God.

"Riker gets off the bridge and into character

While others have pointed out the surprising nature of this episode's hypothesis, the thing that impresses me most about ""Future Imperfect"" is how its premise allows for normalcy. The drama here is propelled by very ordinary concerns: fatherly instincts, the grief of a wife's death, and simple disorientation. Marina Sirtis, divorced from her normal psychobabble, provides an unusually sympathetic performance. And Jonathan Frakes is allowed to step outside his posturing bridge presence to display rather more individual concerns. The result is an episode which contains not only satisfying plot twists but more subtle acting as well.",1

This should have been the best re-release of Fripp's best album, but it's been botched again.

I bought this for my daughter on the spur of the moment (she's 14 months old now) and she just loves it.

And even more of the same with his guitar playing stile. Basist is o'k but makes the music sound too hard and monotonous for ELP. I don't see anything this guys doing better then original ELP unlike others say. Sound and picture quality is o'k. Bonus material isn't helpful unless somebody enjoys watching naked (Keith's?)ass.

"Not for bedtime reading

Like everyone else has said, Book V is rather long, although devoted readers like myself will have no trouble zipping through it. But the one sore spot this book has besides this is the prophecy - it's nothing we didn't already know. The buildup to a final showdown between Harry and Voldemort has been obvious, and of course Harry has to have some hidden power to help him through that. Other than the abovementioned, however, this book is a fascinating read. Just don't start reading it right before bed or you'll end up reading past dawn.",1

This may look like a small scope, but let me tell you the build quality of this thing is outstanding. The optics clarity is so amazing it is hard to look through another scope after using this one.

"The 2nd book is grossly inferior to the first book!

I loved the first book; it was one of the most original, entertaining, action-packed fantasies that I have ever read!

The book starts out promising but is soon bogged down in hopeless action after hopeless action against the evil demons. I so wanted to like it, but it really was a struggle to finish it. I won't give up on the series just yet, but this hard-to-find 2nd book is not worth the money that the used book dealers are holding out for.",0
"World Turned Right Side UP

It difficult to put into words how this book affected my state of mind, challenged things I ""thought"" I knew. Its sad Sanyika had to be born from a Monster in order to be transformed into something greater. No longer a criminal mind. Having read this book, and subsequently getting to know the author I am honored, and beyond impressed with what can take place in a mind, in a being. For the human spirit is ever enduring, and shall prevail in the face of adversity, strife and opposition. This is a HEAVY book.

"Monetarism

This book presents the views of Milton Friedman with the help of his wife Rose Friedman. Friedman was an economic consultant to President Ronald Regan and is a counterpoint to Paul A Samuelson. Samuelson is the modern advocate of Keynesian economics as now fostered by Liberal leaning Economists. Friedman is very detailed in his hypothesis and makes the firm point that certain events which occur in economics can not always be predicted using mathematics. Excellent read.",1
"By far THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN!

These books are without a doubt THE BEST that I have ever read. I first opened them around the age of 8 and devoured ALL of them in an astounding amount of time. They are written as a modern resurgence of ancient celtic mythology. They educate the reader about ancient mythos without their even realizing it (I have read them at least a DOZEN times and it took me awhile to understand this). these novels are much like the Chronicles of Narnia (by C.S. Lewis) in that they are a great story, which has deeper levels if you care to delve into them. The best method I can use to get people to read these is to tell you about my brother. He is a 10 year old boy who is active in sports and hates reading. For school he had to read a book of his choice and I told him to try The Dark Is Rising. It took some doing, but when he really started reading it, he couldn't put it down. Soon after, he read every other book in the series until he had read them all (and was desiring more)",1

"steam is an absolute piece of junk

Well... I have to admit that HL2 is a good game, but steam is an absolute piece of junk. I mean steam literally spoils the whole fun of owning the game. If you have a firewall like zone alarm, steam can really be a pain. I played HL2 and then just gave up on episode 1 onwards. My computer has a quad core processor with a 8800 GTS card but Episode 1 crashes so frequently that I have just given up playing the game.I have been gaming for quite a while and this is one of the worst game I have come across (frequent crashing + steam). What a waste of money.About steam: It's a malware (you can also call it a spamware) program without which your games just wont run.

"Classic 1969 book about grief stages that defined mainstream views about a person's grief

In this classic book about grief, Kubler-Ross explains the stages of grief that became widely used in the grief and loss field. The media's use of Kubler-Ross's stages- denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance--created mainstream acceptance of Kubler-Ross's findings. An interesting book to give you a revered author's view of the grief and loss process based on her research. Some newer books have dismantled some of the views expressed in this book. I would suggest reading this book and others like the Grief Recovery handbook to broaden your understanding about grief.-- Jamieson Haverkampf,author of the 4-time award-winning 500+ resource guide Mom Minus DadMom Minus Dad: The Essential Resource Guide for Busy Adults with a Newly Widowed Parent",1
"The cheesy ""Lawrance Welk"" of western swing...

I think it might be the UN-Swinging sound of the accordian, that adds commerialism and corniness to these otherwise ok sessions. Of course it is the annoying ever-present accordian that gives these western swing sessiosn that cornball Lawrence welk sound. You are much better off buying his competitors cd's, which are much less commercial and more swinging. There is also a lack of any horn sections, or hot solos and the pedal guitarists playing isn't too inspiring and rather stiff at times. Overall these are decent sessions, if there had been less accordian playing, I would have given this three stars, but this is strictly commerical music, and lacks the idea of WESTERN SWING, mixing hillbilly music with jazz. however cooley mixed Hillbilly music(not with jazz) with cornball music, rather then swing(or jazz), though some of the songs swing, but not too much.",0

"Civ3 Complete

I started playing Civilization 3 about when it first came out and then upgraded to the Conquests expansion some time later. From the first it was a very addicting game, though I did always find myself wanting a better and more tactical combat experience - this did not take away from my overall enjoyment of the game, however. With the separate releases I found that the game would begin to work more and more slowly as I progressed though a game, this problem seems to have been addressed in the ""Complete Edition"", however as even once the whole map has been settled I have noticed no slowing down whatsoever, and the game moves just as quickly as it did at game-start.",1
"Fine recording and interpretation

The 5th symphony is a beautiful work of many textures and is not so easily interpreted to reveal all the inner beauty and power of the whole. This rendition of the two symphonies is a very desirable addition to any serious collection, but my reference performance of the 5th is by Eugene Ormandy and the then outstanding Philadelphia Orchestra. The Telarc recording is beautiful with attention to the heavy percussion elements as well as the sheen of the strings and detail to the inner voices. All things considered, a fine choice.",1

The video also covers farming and tractors, bread making (a little off the title's subject, but interesting anyhow) and product delivery. Zimmo's voice can be irritating for the grownup, but boys seem to enjoy the action and educational aspects of this series, which includes spelling out of words and Fun Facts (includes statistics and other stuff which I didn't know).

"Very average series -- disappointing features

This is a very average SF series. For most of the episodes I found myself checking the time to see how much time was left. Most of the story line is not at all compelling, though there are some episodes that are quite good. The acting leaves a lot to be desired; however, Lexa Doig is well worth watching. That cannot be said for most of the special effects, which appear to be vintage 1970 and used repetitively. As for the DVD set itself, I like the compact package. I really liked the price; I got my set for $80.00. The deleted scenes are okay and the ""tours"" with the cast are very interesting. The bloopers are lame; surely there were more and funnier mess ups. One big NEGATIVE is the lack of close captioning. Overall, I am not unhappy that I bought the set, but I will not put Andromeda in my ""will watch again"" pile as I did with Firefly and B5. In fact, I will most likely put it on ebay.",0

"Every school should have this

It's rather amazing that a book on punctuation can be written so extensively and at the same time, provide much comic relief. Through this book, you'll realize that despite having been well-schooled, there are so many punctuation mistakes that we commit without even realizing the gravity of the errors. More often than not, the incorrect placement or omission of these nitty gritty symbols can lead to miscommunication and the result is often diasastrous and comical.Lynne Truss presents the different punctuation marks in different chapters which include illustrations of wrong usage, explanations of the history and evolution of the punctuations and of course, the correct usage. The coverage is rather comprehensive, if not all encompassing.I encourage anyone to give it a read. All schools should stock a few of these and teachers can use the book as an instructional guide without being being a bore.",1
"Buy it as toy

The summary: buy it as toy -don't expect to get a lot of reading out of it.My child loves this book. She likes the Disney Princesses, and gets a big kick out of operating the projector and making up stories for the pictures. I agree with other reviewers, the light level in the room has to be too low to read in order to view the pictures, which right there defeats the purpose of the set, which is to be able to read the book AND view the projected images at the same time. Maybe an older kid that is not that interested in the pictures would do better with the reading side of it.I still give it a high mark because of the many hours my kid has spent playing with it. She is rough on the projector and the disks and they have taken it well so far.",1

The show itself, lights and effects, is remarkably well done with professional, tasteful, artistic camera work through out. Well worth adding to your musical video collection.",1
"Cheap copy

The disk arrived in a plastic box used for CD's-- not a regular package. The installation directons, printed on the disk itself, state that auto-run will begin when the disk is inserted in the disk drive. Nothing happened and I had to use My Computer and the Setup.exe file to start the installation. About halfway thru the process, it stopped and would not restart. Our son (a computer guy) said the disk is a standard cheap copy type that we can purchase anywhere-- not the usual higher quality that Broderbund would use. Finally we got it installed on the main computer but it would not install on my laptop. I guess it's true-- you get what you pay for. This was cheap enough and that's good. If I have any more problems, I will return it to Amazon.",0

The steps are explained simply and a strategy on how to make ""it happen"".It is really useful because it gives a variety of examples from many different organizations and industries. It is the kind of book that you can use, sitting around with your staff, to agree on the process that you will take for your particular organization.I highly recommend it to an organization that wants to make their strategic approach stick.

If you like 50's and 60's music, especially pop or beach music,you'll like this. I like ""Pineapple Princess"" a lot, even though it's often spoken of in less than glowing terms. But I remember listening to it when I was a very small child and I just loved it. It's true that I've wondered how the boy she sings about could sing his songs ""from banana trees"" when the only banana trees I've ever seen don't have branches suitable for climbing. But hey, what do I know about Hawaiian banana trees? I also love ""Let's Get Together"" and some of the silly, obviously-made-for-the-current-Disney-movie songs like ""Monkey's Uncle"" and ""Merlin Jones."" These are songs from a different era. Live a little, go visit the music your parents or grandparents liked!",1

"Insightful!

Mary Beth O'Neill describes how executive coaches need to work with executives as partners to help them become better leaders. Coaches need the strength to share the truth with clients in times of crisis, she explains. She discusses the core principles that underlie coaching and the four essential phases of the coaching process: contracting, planning, live-action intervening and debriefing. The book is primarily directed to coaches, including consultants and internal or external trainers, who facilitate processes and projects in organizations. While it has its share of fuzzy and jargon-laden patches, the book is generally clear and to the point. It includes a mix of examples, charts, and step-by-step techniques, plus useful chapter highlights. We [...] recommend this book to coaches, to executives who are coaching employees and to executives who are being coached.",1

"No problems after 3 1/2 years

I have 2 of these gates, one for the top and one for the bottom of my stairs. I have had them up for 3 1/2 years, as I have 3 children 3 and under. They are used extremely often during the day, and neither one has had a problem with the lock breaking.Another reviewier said they used the hands free gate instead. This is also a great gate (we have it blocking off one of the rooms downstairs). However, that gate is NOT DESIGNED to be placed at the top of the stairs!If you are looking for a gate for the top of stairs I would recommend this Simple & Secure gate. You can have the gate swing only one way, so if something does break you don't have to worry about your child leaning into it and falling down the stairs. Easy to use, and only needs one hand to open.",1

"Grim and somewhat disappointing

This book is a compilation of several radio lectures that the German- or Austrian-born author (the name is a pseudonym) delivered over French radio in, if memory serves, the 1950s. I confess to have made it only through the first section and part of the second. The tone is extremely bleak, the prose is difficult (all French prose defies easy translation, IMHO, and comes out sounding imprecise and windy), and the ultimate message is pretty unrewarding: It turns out that old age is even worse than you feared! Don't pick up this book looking for any solace.",0

I bought this CD after I had already purchased Pat Metheny Group's great ""Imaginary Day"" CD.I did not know what to expect. I enjoy, and am always open to anything by Metheny.Sometimes I need to warm up to his work, but I have learnt that with each listen I enjoy it more.There are 4 songs on the CD.2 are the original Metheny mixes of Across the Sky and Roots of Coincidence from ""Imaginary Day""2 are totally off the wall remixed version of those two songs, buy other (I suppose avant garde) mixing studios (not Metheny).The original Metheny version are great, but they are on the Imaginary Day CD (a complete fabulous set of songs)I personally can't listen to the remixes. I've tried. I suppose they would appeal to someone, but I would find it unlikely that someone would be a Pat Metheny Group fan.So, I can't listen to it. I can't bring myself to toss it.So now it's just taking up room in my collection in case it becomes (rare and valuable).I hate that!Charlieboy.",0

I heard one of the IM9 systems at a Best Buy store and thought it sounded great. The store didn't have one so I ordered online (for less $). When I received it, their was an odd pop in the bass at reasonably low volumes. I actually took it to the store to compare it to the one there, and it sounded bad! The store still didn't have one so I exchanged it online. The second one does the same as the first. I will return this one and probably buy something else. It's a great idea, but the quality of sound wasn't consistent. It also has no treble/bass adjustment. The sound at the store was fairly heavy on the bass.",0

"Misrepresents the dominant muslim thought

This is a brave attempt by the author to address one of the thorniest issue among the world Muslim population, but the author takes a very partisan view of Muslim community in US. The discussions never really touch upon the fundemental conflict within Islam. Islamic teaching and principles are not analyzed in the light of current socio-economic meileu, but instead glossed over. The author could have done a much better job of enlightining the world about inherent conflicts in Koran, and the different interpretation of it. However, he protrays a west-friendly picture, so that it is palatable to the west , but is largely out of sync with fundemental muslim thinking.",0

"Not a character worth caring about

I read this book solely because my husband was impressed with it, and it turned out to be the dreariest reading experience I've suffered through in years. ""Devices and Desires"" is a beautifully-written story about an assortment of people who are either too weak-willed, too incompetent, or too boring to care about.The only exception, Parker's protagonist, Ziani Vaatzes, is interesting but morally repulsive. He is bright enough to see outside the box that his culture tries to keep him in, but is amoral enough to use his impressive skills literally to start wars and pull down nations to achieve his own personal objectives; ""sociopath"" would not be too strong a word to describe him. Parker does nothing to make Vaatzes more sympathetic to the reader as the book proceeds.In short, if you enjoy well-crafted prose but do not demand characters worth caring about, you may enjoy ""Devices and Desires""; otherwise, I'd recommend avoiding it.",0

"Page-turning anti-chick lit

This was my first novel by Emily Barr and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Her main character, Evie, was a fleshed-out, three-dimensional person who carries a lot of baggage over a traumatic incident in her teens and allows it to affect all her relationships from that point on.Over the course of the novel, she readily admits her character flaws, which I appreciated as the reader, and over time sorts her ""stuff"" out, but not all the way, which lended realism to the plot.My only complaint about the book was the secondary ""mystery"" plot which kind of fell flat. But overall I like Barr's style and will be looking up her other titles.",1

I was really excited when I bought this CD. I unwrapped the case thinking that the same driving tunes that had played on the big screen would be piped through my headphones into my waiting ears. Instead I was assaulted with track after track of nothing but rap. Call me crazy but I think that techno was the staring music in this movie. There were three songs on the CD that I remember from the movie and found tolerable. I know the movie had a large sound track and it would be impossible to fit it on one CD but maybe they should have included some more recognizable songs. If they were to release another CD with the techno on it but I would say this CD was not worth the price I paid unless you really like rap",0
"Worst piece of engineering...

Less than poor design. The fuel adjustment lever is a silver-painted plastic part: it's lower portion is a toothed ring which easily falls off the (true) metal gas flow gear inside the torch housing. There's no retainer nut to hold the ring on the gear, only friction, and far too much mechanical play. Once the ring comes off the gear the torch is unusable. After 2 uses the housing had to be taken apart to re-mate the parts and adjust the locking button, a process that has been required several times in the past 18 months. The igniter also stopped working after the first repair.I went out to use it today and found it broken again, and that was the last straw. I don't have 30 minutes to fix the tool each time I want to use it, so into the garbage it goes. You'll need all 4 of these to last a year. This is the worst piece of engineering I've seen in a long time. Don't waste your time or money on this one.",0

Even though I am experienced programmer in VB, there were many tidbits of information that I got from this book. The fact that is such an easy read makes it all that much better.I have read some other harsh reviews. In all fairness, this book is geared toward someone new to web application development. Murach tries to encompass what would take about 4 books and much development time if one were to become an expert in web application development.If you are interested in learning the basics of web app development, this is good place to start. If you are more experienced at programming, then there are many things you can take away from this book(especially from the later chapters).",1

My daughter enjoyed this toy for about a week - it was her first handheld game so she was naturally excited about it even though it's not much fun. It's biggest problem is that it doesn't have an OFF button and it goes on and on before it finally gets quiet (back in the days she occasionally played with it, she would shove it into a closet or under a pillow when she was finished). The second biggest problem is that it seems to have a mind of its own and randomly starts talking when no one is touching it (Nothing I hate more than a haunted toy). I haven't even seem my daughter's game since moving into a new house four months ago. I know it's there because I hear it talking on a regular basis.

In my 5 years playing EQ, i have only seen Sony make bad decision after bad decision, release 5 ( or is it now 7 .. 8??!!) money grubbing expansions and consistantly ignore their absurdly loyal customer base. MMGs, even more than other games, require companies that pay attention and value their customer base, and also PLAY and LOVE these games themselves.

It is written and illustrated in such a way that one can either read it all at once, skip chapters, or skim through various sections without loss of continuity. The underlying feminist tone underscores its points with humorous musings and little known historical facts. The book is rich and creative with interactive exercises that are designed to make teenage girls feel good about themselves and to help support each other. The positive and encouraging attitude makes it refreshing to read.",1
"It works as advertised

I have purchased both units separately. The small unit can pickup heads of nail etc in walls but it is not sensitive enough to check for metal in wood before planing. The large red unit is great - it has an ear piece so you can hear sound as it senses metal while you in a noisy shop or other area as well as a vibrating mode or both.I did one sensitivity test. I drove 1/2"" 18guage finish nail from my air gun into a 3/4"" block of wood recessing it a fraction of an inch below the surface. The big unit picked up the brad on both sides of the wood. The little unit couldn't find it. I believe it's because their isn't enough mass in the tiny nail. If you like to recycle lumber or repair old furniture then the red unit will save your planer and saw blades which = frustration and money. It's great for finding hidden nails in repaired furniture",1

"Harness Bra

My Wacoal minimizer is a good, strong, bra that's lifts my big heavy 34G breasts and that's saying something... I refer to the bra as my bosom harness because of the way that I feel when I'm wearing the bra is the way that I imagine I'd feel if I were harnessed to some piece equipment. Needless to say, the bra isn't very comfortable to wear, but it does hold up my breasts, contains them with no cupcake look, and that's my main concern, because no other bra that I've purchased in the past has been able to accomplish lifting/holding up my breasts. I can't see where the bra minimizes my bosom in fact, my breasts appear jutted out and bigger because they're lifted up so I guess I'll just have to live with that; but all in all, I like the bra, it works, and it is worth the high price that Wacoal charges for it. One suggestion, Wacoal might consider installing a four-hook back closure instead of a three hook closure on the bra.",1

Its obvious the author is also passionate about them, but it is a shame that was not translated into a usable guide. I have a number of waterfall books from many states, this is by far the poorest in providing directions.The author also uses the book as her own religious platform, to the point of questioning the validity of science and geology rather than letting people appreciate the waterfalls as they are.

"For all those interested in the Diary form

I agree with the Amazon reviewer above who suggests that this book would have been much better in ' encyclopediac' rather than narrative form. There are too just too many diarists mentioned and the discussion of them goes from one to the other too rapidly. Mallon breaks his diarists into seven categories, chroniclers, travelers, pilgrims, creators, apologists, confessors, prisoners.The old rule seemed to apply here, and the less I knew about the diarist the more Mallon 's work seemed significant. But for those whose work I do somehow know , and I think here of the example of Kafka , Mallon's treatment seemed to me hasty, and slight. This suggests that another problem of doing the work the way Mallon did is distinguishing well enough between diarists of greater and lesser significance.This book is highly recommended for all those who take interest in the Diary form, for I know of nothing else like it.",1

These are Carol's favorites? They are not mine. There is at least the ""Went with the Wind"" sketch. But I can think of so many other sketches that were much funnier than the ones on these discs. Does anyone remember the Snow White sketch? She was Snow White after 30 years of marriage to Prince Charming (Harvey Korman) and Lyle Waggoner was the Mirror who kept making rude comments about her? That was much funnier than the skits on here. I'm sorry Carol, but I do not recommend this set.",0

I know it must be a pain in the ass to be hounded by these creeps but murder is not a positive move. THe police even know its him but, they let him go cause the press is bad really bad.

"Outstanding piece of historical fiction

This trilogy, written in diary form, is in many ways a remarkable achievement. It steers clear of the pitfalls of historical fantasy, yet brings history vividly to life. Gullard traces the highly improbable destiny of this girl from the colonies who astonishly became an Empress. Josephine was a tough woman who survived a miserable first marriage and the horrors of the French revolution, in which she was imprisoned and nearly beheaded. A pragmatist, she made her way up again by becoming a politician's mistress, and then married the young Bonaparte to get security and respectability. The books sheds real light on the influence that women have in political and historical events even when kept behind the scenes. This is not a sentimental book but it is well enough written and full of the pleasures of political intrigue.",1
"Great book!

"A hard read

I've read all three books and I can honestly say that I'm happy that I've ended the story. On the whole, the story is a good one. Though too orchestrated for it to become the adventure it should have been. The colour was taken away with the lacking detail and the telling of it. The author's third person style grated on me from the outset. I imagined little children sitting around her feet as she told a children's tale, careful not to mention gory details or an impolite word. It is the kind of story where if there was a need for something, voila, it was there. I believe that this story could have been so much more than it was. The characters just didn't get a chance to tell it though.I'm disappointed by the telling the most.",0
"I have seen better

Hi, I have read about 10 books about wealth creation and this one is not the best. This book is more about having a ""great"" attitude rather than real example of how to buy a property. The example in the books might work but the fact is to buy a location property you need money (at least some) or equity. This book make us dream but from my point of view the examples are far from my Canadian reality.",0
"Better than its reputation here....

I'd like to preface this by saying that this is the first of anything that I've read by Andrew Klavan; thus, I'm not burdened by Klavan's other novels. Hey, ""True Crime"" may be a masterpiece, and ""Animal Hour"" could be fantastic, I don't know. I did read this novel, ""The Uncanny"", however, and I was very pleased with it.I profess a weakness (like Storm in the novel) for English ghost stories, so perhaps the novel spoke to me more so than my fellow reviewers here. Overall, I found the book to be well-written and very interesting. It wasn't scary, as some of the others have pointed out, but I don't think Klavan was trying to upstage King here. What he's written is an interesting and entertaining thriller, filled with some clever supernatural / occult additives, and the result is entirely pleasing.Recommended.",1

Bjork really must have had to get something out of her system.There's lots of ""noodling"" going on, and many of the songs seem incomplete and not well thought out.Bjork will definitely not gain any new fans with this CD, and long-time fans (of which I count myself) will listen first before buying the next one.This CD is bad.

"Minus 1 = 0 stars! The disposable HP Scanner...

The lesson I've learned here is never buy an HP scanner with a 90 day warranty. Most of their ""higher quality"" scanners have at least a 1 year warranty, but this low end scanner comes with a 90 day. Apparently, that is just about the lifetime of the scanning bulb. Mine burned out two weeks out of warranty and their support told me ""you might as well buy a new one for the cost of replacing a bulb"". Nice!They should build these with a cardboard casing and sell them on shelves at K-Mart as the ""disposable Scanner"".It'll cost a little more (initially), but I recommend the Epson 1200 U.

Although there are a lot of similarities between this book and other self help books out there, like setting goals, knowing what you want, etc, this book goes over the spiritual side to getting what you want.

If you love politics and political humor, you will roll on the floor while you watch this terrific movie.

Helen Thomas and several other prominent reporters and politicians also toss in their two cents worth. Well worth watching, you won't regret the time you spend on it. You may keep asking yourself, has this been done in real life?",1
"Serious Problems with Kindle Version

I purchased this book despite another review warning about the Kindle edition. One reason I did was that the introduction is so long that when you download the sample, you only see the introduction, not any of the poems, so there was no way to test the layout issue the other reviewer raised. I figured I could probably handle the confusion, but I was unfortunately very wrong. The book was completely unreadable in its Kindle version -- the printed version is laid out on facing pages (Spanish and English), and when this is ported to Kindle, those two versions of each poem become completely garbled with each other and impossible to follow. I was very disappointed, because from all appearances, the text of the book itself is excellent. I would absolutely buy this book in print, but it needs to be reformatted before it is usable on the Kindle.(Note: I read Kindle books in an app on my Android phone, so that's the format I was seeing)",0

Anne Perry chooses one theme to explore in the books I read by her; Dark Assassin, shows the life of the workers in the bed of the Thames, all the various tasks done by poor children and poor men in the way of earning one's living. the novel being an entertaining detective story , she gives pace and speed elegantly to the plot of a realistic novel dealing with the building of the new sewers in London in Victorian times. Both genres mix quite well and result in a well written book quite pleasant to read",1
"You have got to be kidding.

This stove is unsafe. The flue collar does not fit a standard 6 inch flue. The wood burns so rapidly that the stove warps. I went through a face cord of dry hard wood in 3 days. I had to load wood every 45 minutes. If you use the damper the fire goes out. There is no way to regulate the in take of air. The 65 cfm fan is a joke. The fan blows through a 3' by 6' cut out in the rear sheet metal of the stove. You would get more air flow blowing across the top of the stove. I bought the stove from Northern Tool because I live so close to a store. I returned the stove on the fourth day. I spoke with a salesperson at a fireplace store, and he said the Vogelzanz was no longer allowed at trade shows. I gave this stove one star so that I could warn people about Vogelzang products.

"Rushed and not very informative

As an experienced Oneironaut and somebody who is very educated on the subject, I don't really like this book. I got this back when I was starting out with lucid dreaming and had been for about 6 months. This book was very demanding and the tasks it was saying to do could not always be done in one day. It pretty much expects you to lucid dream within about 10 days, which is incredibly unrealistic.I really do not like this book. To me, it sounds like the person wasn't that educated on the subject. Please, don't waste your money on this. It really does not include a lot of information and the title makes it very misleading.Definitely go by Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen La Berge. It is a much better book.",0

The mystery of ""Darker than Amber"" is resolved fairly early on in the plot, but that doesn't diminish the story. I thoroughly enjoyed this-- my third Travis McGee.

"Making good knifes is difficult

Making good knifes is difficult. Making good wooden blocks to store knives, isn't, that is why there are much cheaper. I bought the 14 piece set for $25 during a promotion, and that is what the block is worth. The knifes are not entirely worthless, however, if you cook a lot (and I mean really a lot), think twice about this set of knifes. The steak knifes are o.k., at least to cut grapefruits. The scissors are great. The paring knives don't hold their sharpness long enough. The bread knife is o.k. The vegetable knife is a big disappointment. It cuts sideways, and is almost always blunt.I guess the wisdom holds true: If something is too good to be true (i.e., getting 14 knives for $25 (or even $80)), then it probably isn't.",0
"great buy for great music

I agree with the reviewer above that this is an excellent recording. I must strongly disagree with Mr. Hurwitz. I am a loyal fan of Ian Partridge, who is a regular favorite of mine for any lyric work whether baroque or early romantic, and he will not fail to disappoint those who like what he has done in the past here. The orchestra is a wonderful compliment, not a surprise seeing that it's the ASMF, no matter who they're under. I've never heard them take something at a rediculous pace or throw around baroque lines as if they were trying to hurl them to the back of the auditorium rather than letting them glide. That's not to say that they are of that dead, tinny sounding orchestra type either. A very good medium for those not used to pre 1960 recordings yet not satisfied with the newer interpretations like Gardiner/ some Harnoncourt. A bit like Sir Colin Davis.",1

"A joke

The premise is interesting, but the execution and political campaigning is amateurish. I'm a big fan of the techno-thrillers, but Patrick Robinson's pro-GOP, anti-Democrat bent is ridiculous... bordering on juvenile. This book is more like an episode of Johnny Quest as written by Rush Limbaugh. If you have only moments to spare before your plane starts boarding and this is the only available book at the news stand, then maybe give it a try. But you may be better off just staring at the seatback in front of you.",0
"Not Impressed

I really thought this was going to be something amazing based on the trailer. I wasn't a big fan of the original, but this looked interesting. I like a lot of the new remakes that have bee coming out.This is a well made film. And I appreciate that a lot of the original cheese was removed. The rape scene was appalling and unless I just supressed the memory of the first film, it's much worse. Given the horror of what Mary endures, I didn't feel like the kill/revenge scenes were as satisfying as the original. I felt the parents often bumbled around and made a lot of cliché horror movie mistakes. It's definitely an intense movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat, but I also heard myself screamng ""OH COME ON!"" an awful lot.If anyone is interested, the Italian film, Night Train Murders (1975) was a much better rip-off of Last House on the Left.",0

"A fun album despite the circumstances

This album was a bit of a pleasant surprise to me. I expected songs about finality, endings and even death, but there is far more here that speaks to life. Mr. Zevon's musical talents have always been appreciated by me in a ""Wow! That sounds great!"" or ""Man, that's gotta be the best lyric ever!"" kind of way, but in these songs I discover a different kind of appreciation. I'm amazed at how beautifully these songs seem to sum up Mr. Zevon's acceptence of his own mortality while celebrating the things living has to offer. I find a personal message here. It's as if Mr. Zevon is telling me himself that life really is short and we can't waste a minute of it. Through it all his legendary wit still rings through. And while it saddens me deeply to know he'll never write another song, I can't help but smile when I hear him sing, ""And if she won't love me then her sister will.""

A masterful recording. A trio of the highest caliber. Each piece is jazz in it's highest form.

I purchased the Bosch TKA 2801 about two months ago and it's been nothing but trouble. To begin with, it feels cheap, with plastic moving parts that feel like they're about to fall off at any moment, and often do. But worse, unless one is very careful with the unit, more coffee will end up on your kitchen counter than in the carafe when the coffee is brewed. It's no fun to clean that mess over and over. I called Bosch customer service and was treated very rudely, but after complaining I was referred to an outside service agent that has been quite pleasant to deal with so far. They've offered to pay for me to ship the unit to them and they're sending me a completely new unit. Hopefully the new one will function better, although I'm not holding my breath given the poor design overall.",0

I have been using the product for a few years now for painful knees. I am now back to jogging every day and I believe this product helped me recover. The company is bit pushy, but they have the best product in my opinion if you believe you have damaged cartilidge.For a problem like this, which is related to damaged cartilidge, recovery can take a long time. Patience is key, as is doing the right type of exercises. If you have painful knees, strengthening the quadriceps is very important. Try going up stairs backwards, jogging backwards. This pulls the patella upwards, very crucial to healthy knees. Also, do not run with fancy overly cushioned shoes. Use minimal shoes: I recommend the book ""Born to Run"" by McDougal[...].",1

I think people are giving this book a negative rating, not because it's a bad suspense story, but because it's not a Mary Higgins Clark suspense novel.

"Not enough product description

Why on earth do we need to read reviews in order to find out Product Description that the MANUFACTURER should have provided? When you want to buy a tea set, first things you want to know (besides the look, which you can tell from the picture) are THE SIZE and if it's porcelain or plastic. These things are esential to know, as you won't buy the same thing for a toddler tea party and for a 8 year old tea party. Doesn't it seem ridiculous to gave a 8 year old a tea cup that fits a tablespoon of tea?So my review is mostly for the manufacturer: write properly the product description and if the product is great, you won't have one star ratings just because people didn't receive what they were expecting. It is very frustating to get a wrong gift for your child just because the lack of information!!!",0
"Thought Provoking / Puts Mankind In Perspective

I really like space documentaries and this one is unique in depth and thought provoking analogies. For example, when touring our solar system from the sun outward the viewer arrives at Saturn and is told that it would take a modern airliner over a century to get here. When you arrive at the nearest star to our solar system you are informed that it would take the Space Shuttle over 150,000 years to get here. You get the idea. The graphics coupled with this kind of presentation makes it a winner for me. BTW, When my wife watches this she looks at it with her head tilted just like a dog when hearing a sound they don't understand. My own analogy just for you.",1

"Great music, HORRIBLE CD. Poor quality, no liner

Music is absolutely great. But it sounds like a cheap copy. Music quality is horrible, even considering it was recorded in 1971. CD has no liner notes, no nothing, and the cover is just script that says Herbie Mann, Push Push. Not even the proper album cover (not that I really wanted to see it, but still). Wish there were a better way to get obscure music, this was a very diappointing experience through Amazon.",0

...And so the Night became is a breath of fresh air.

That was until i found this. I opened it and looked through the booklet before actually listening. The Lyrics are like verses from mystical tales...great stuff,and the girl,whatever her name is,is pretty. ..Then i put off my lights and just lay down in bed and listen to this straight through 3 times! yeah! and this CD is over an hour long! That's how good it is. Track 3,Warrior of the Cresent Moon may very well be my favorite song ever. I plan on getting all the other albums from this band, Aeternus.

Once I heard those first few quirky notes in the first scene of ""Igby Goes Down"",I knew I was in for a long,painful ride.Basically,""Igby"" is a cliche-ed Hollywood film poorly disguised as an independent film.The acting is poor (especially Sarandon).The writing is even worse.The script is so bad,that it relies on the soundtrack in order to set mood-sort of like a bad children's film or romantic comedy.The film is so awful,that it tainted my memories of ""The Catcher in the Rye""!The only good thing about it was that it proved a long discussed theory-the rich have it so good that they have to invent problems in order to prevent dying from boredom.Besides,I know a movie can't be too thought-provoking if it has either a)Bill Pullman in it or b) Coldplay in the soundtrack.",0

""Until the 1970s, Oman was an isolated, almost medieval kingdom, virtually unknown to the outside world. The 1970 palace coup that brought Sultan Qaboos b.

Development programs made modernization a rapid process, and Oman's location at the netrance to the Straits of Hormuz gave the county an increasing importance to U.S. security interests....""154 pages, in dustcover, cloth over hardback boards with a sewn binding.

"The Dream Team

The Triple and Double can hardly be said to be the crowning achievements of Beethoven's and Brahms' concerto output, but this team makes as good a case for them as anybody. All three soloists have made extensive recordings of the solo concerto repertoire, but here, they show that they can be team players, too. The pianist in the Triple or the violinist in the Double might feel slighted that he/she does not get enough of the limelight compared to his/her partners, but there is never an attempt by any of these three men to steal each other's thunder; they all have a great deal of respect for one another's musicianship.This is one of ten CDs that I own in EMI's ""Great Recordings of the Century"" series, and I have not been disappointed by a single one of them. This CD in particular lives up to the designation.",1

As a big fan of Bob's Red Mill products in general I thought I'd try ordering this since my grocery store does not sell it.

In order to make it taste better, the following healthy additions work for me:2 packs of splenda and cinnamon to taste1-2 Tbsp of fat free vanilla yogurt, greek yogurt or cottage cheese to make it creamieroptional: dried fruit or stewed prunesI sometimes mix this 50/50 with regular oatmeal, which also gives it great texture.",1
"Read This Book !

This is a great read that blurs the line between science fiction and fantasy genres! Others have tried melding the supernatural with science fiction (such as Poul Anderson in ""Operation Chaos""), but with nowhere near the success of Rachel Pollack. Unlike some other writers, she obviously understands something about magical beliefs and rituals, and does a great job of imaginatively integrating this into a high tech future and a suspenseful plot. After you read this, you may want to read ""Unquenchable Fire"" too, since it is set in the same futuristic world.",1

This obvious attempt to kill the `franchise' should have been in 3D. Why did they kill off Hicks, anyway? Perhaps the filmmakers were they afraid someone interesting would be placed in the movie.

"A Major Disappointment

When I first heard that RPG Maker 2 was going to be released, I knew I had to get it. I have a few ideas for rpg's and RPG maker 2 was going to help me bring those ideas to life....or so I thought. I found many flaws in the game right off the bat.1. Characters: You are forced to use just the characters that came with the game. You CAN NOT create your own character from scratch.2. Enemies: Just like characters, enemies can not be created from scratch.3. Map Creator: Extremely complex and very annoying to try to figure out.4. Battle: Today's RPG's must use side battle system. So both enemies and hero party can be seen.If you don't mind the above problems and you love to make rpg's of any kind then by all means this is for you. Otherwise, it is best to skip it and hope that a rpg maker title will come out allowing us to fully customize our rpg ideas. Preferrably one that supports the PSX 2's hard drive and of course keyboard.",0

Was a bit disappointed when I received the item in the mail. Container holding the charcoal was tin-ny and cheap. I guess the contents themselves (pieces of charcoal, other pencils) were all fine- it's just that the presentation/box it came in was lacking. Also discovered that the outside cardboard and plastic packaging was damaged and partly opened. Made me question how reputable the company was- and why I didn't just go for a more recognizable brand (Faber Castell, Strathmore, etc). Disappointed since I was giving it as a gift. Ended up purchasing another set- post-Christmas, a Prisma-Color collection from Strathmore. The packaging/presentation was much nicer. I guess this set would have been fine- if you were looking to pay less money and didn't need it as a gift.",0

The game is excelent. More movements, simplified Sands of Time mechanism, the combos, etc. But the major flaw of the game (at least the GC version) is that the sound editing is very poor.

On cutscenes, the voice and the image don't mach, making it anoying, and the very last dialogue with the defeated final boss has no sound at all.The game is excelent thoug, and I'm waiting for part 3 to be released soon, but with another sound department for god's sake...",1

This faux-documentary horror movie is is not it, it's really horrible !The cover looks complelling, and you might be compelled to spend $22 to buy it just to find out it's worth no more than $1 (to rent at the Redbox and avoid the ache of owning it).I give the movie plot 1 star, perfomance 3 stars, therefore 2 stars.",0

Even sliced potatoes or veggies in a pan with a little bouillon made using this will taste great. Rarely have I come across a food product to rave about but this has really made my life easier. The organic chicken version is fantastic in chicken stew - throw in some barley or wild rice and basta!

And they built on the standout brilliant ""20 Cases Suggetsive of..."" of of Discovery of World. Two singularly important bands come to mind -- the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain -- which (mostly the former) have given rise to a whole string of great bands that I know little about, like the Donnas and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

Tears streamed from my eyes in an unlikely emotional release the first time that I listened to this treasure from an artist whose ""Ring of Fire"" and """"I'll Walk The Line"" had been etched in my memory long ago.

His ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" is expressive of a uncompromisingly sincere level of wizened, heart felt compassion. ""In My Life"" will rip your heart out.The pathos of it all is heard here; yes, the human condition, the living in it, the dying, the passing and all of our changes.

Got this set at a very good price on Amazon. These are wonderful, sharp, heavy knives. I used the carving knife the other day to cut some marbling out of a roast, and it was SO EASY. I normally cannot stand working with raw meat. Also, had no problems thinly slicing a flank steak, and, of course, the steak knives cut through a filet like butter! Also, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the case.",1
"Looks like their destiny has been fulfilled...

...as crap.What happened to their energy and their unique sound?? All the songs on here are all extremely generic R&B; songs. Granted I can see that they wanted to mature their sound a bit or something, but come ON. This is slow...and useless. I could pick up ANY girl R&B; group, and get the same effect as this album.I like Lose My Breath and Through With Love. That's about it. All the other songs are just kind of their, and I just don't get my groove on with any of it.I have to say I'm disappointed. It leaves me wondering if Beyonce killed the group's sound with her solo CD, because THAT sounded just like Destiny's Child. Makes sense though, since Beyonce's father is their manager. Go figure.I wouldn't buy this. I don't like it. It unfulfilling, and generic smokescreen.Ah well, what can you do. *shrugs*",0
"Sex and the City DVD set

Great purchase. Packaging is beautiful. Fun book to flip through, well organized, features the best photos and quotes from the show pulled out on translucent overlays. Included all seasons and both movies. Highly recommend for anyone that loves this series. Amazon had special one day sale for $100. Saw the series box set at Best Buy, different packaging and did not include the movies for $199.",1

The theme, which is all that Elfman contributed to this set, is stand-alone, the best track in the entire album. It maintains a great tempo, and reminds you of some deep and dark introduction to some masterful movie.The rest of the tracks are excellent and blend nicely, while complimenting Elfman's work.You would almost expect this to be a piece for a movie, it doesn't have the feeling of a game composition at all.",1

Our daughter, who is now 3, loves these magnets!!! After speaking with a specialist, about some suggestions to help with our daughters speech, she said magnets were a huge help! Well, if she wasn't right on the money!!!

Yes, we also meet with a speech therapist once a week...and maybe this is more information that some folks need, but for those of you whose child is on the spectrum, this has been a really positive reinforcement, doesn't cost a lot, and watching your child smile and clap because things are starting to make sense, is worth every penny!!!

While the dialogue was not on the par of the Lord of the Rings or Gladiator, Troy makes up for it in its effects.

"One of the finest concept albums of the seventies

Jeff Lynne has written a lot of so-so middle of the road songs in his long career as singer-songwriter, but Eldorado is without doubt one of his artistic heights. ""Legend"" has it that his dad complained about earlier tracks saying that 'your tunes have no bloody tune', and so Jeff set out to construct Eldorado.And man, has he succeeded or what. There's magic twinkling all over the place. For once, the exuberant strings do not dull the music, but rather enrich it, while there are even some subtle experimental sounds added. Again, this album breathes musical magic all over and I've never met anyone who regretted buying this album.",1

I read Into Thin Air in school. After hearing from many other students, I wasn't really looking forward to reading this book. After getting into the story, I changed my mind.The story starts off somewhat slow, as they are not on the mountain yet, but picks up after the 7th chapter. It is one of those books that you want to read straight through. It always leaves you on the edge, wanting to read more. This book is about the true but sad story of climbers from everest expeditions. They summited at a bad time and got caught in a horrible storm, leaving many climbers behind. I don't know if this book is completely accurate, as it has been challenged many times but no one knows what happened that year for sure.",1

A classic - perhaps the classic - reference book on elegant, timeless, dressing for men. Well-written with a clear love and devotion to the topic. My congratulations to Mr Flusser. I have had the book since its publication and still refer to its contents.Hopefully our brief era of slovenly dress (and crude behaviour) is just an abberation, rather than a sign of permanent Decline of the West. If so, then books like this one, and of course all the men who care to dress (and act) respectably and respectfully, can carry the torch for a resurgence of elegance. Well done.",1

"No reader can ask for anything more.

Oh, man, man, MAN.... what a book! I have just now read the final words. I closed the book slowly, running my hands all over it, before I held it tightly to my heart for a few moments. I do that after great reads. Robert Crais has given me (and the world) a truly great one.As I read LA Requiem, I laughed, I cried, I was fearful, I was shaken, I was envious, I cared, I loathed, I loved. Robert Crais has a gift for saying exactly the right words and phrases that evoke such emotions in his reader. I've read all of Crais' books with that knowledge. But, this one.... this one did it even more powerfully. By telling Joe's story, Crais has plumbed the depths of both Joe and Elvis... and also mine. No reader can ask for anything more.

When I first read all of the other reviews for this book, I had to double-check to make sure that I was writing about the same book!

"Overrated Drivel

I find it interesting that such a supposedly important and relevant contemporary work has only been reviewed by 11 people at the time of this writing. That alone tells you all you need to know since this is a book that is classed under both Latino and Women's Studies, and is part of many university literary programs.The book is pretentious claptrap of the worst kind. If this book were judged on its merits rather than by popular, politically correct notions, it wouldn't come close to making the cut.Alas, academia has embraced the book as a great work, and so it is required reading for an English M.A. program at a major university that I was accepted into. An English M.A.! Once I saw that this book was part of the program, I didn't even bother registering.I don't mind rants against social, cultural and economic injustices. I've read many.

Heartbreaker is Ryan Adams' best album yet. With songs like ""In My Time of Need,"" ""Come Pick Me Up,"" ""Oh My Sweet Carolinia,"" and many others theis album really speaks. Yes, it has a more mellow or quiter sound than his more recent albums, but thats because he's sold out somewhat. This album has a tremendous sound to it and is his best out of his solo career.

"My Toddler Hated This DVD

I am a try-before-you-buy kind of mom when it comes to DVDs, so I rented this DVD from Netflix with hopes that my 18-month-old daughter would love this new Sesame Street offering as she loves all things Elmo. She hated it! We didn't even get halfway through it.It is set up in a game show format and the ""host"" of the show is really loud and obnoxious and has a kind of scary toothy grin at one point and a big scary square head. Every time he came on the screen as the emcee of this game show that Elmo and Zoe are playing, my daughter started to cry and turned away from the show.The older Elmo DVDs have all been a big hit in our house, but the newer ones like the Sesame Beginnings series, which are REALLY boring, even for smaller babies and this one in particular, are really jumbled. This one jumps from shapes to colors to healthy food groups??? What the?!?Anyway, rent this if you must, but don't waste your money on buying it. There are much better Elmo videos out there.",0

Bought the stainless steel+black version, mainly on the advice of Consumer Reports which rated this pot top. Looks great with our other stainless appliances. I would have to agree with other reviewers that the water-pouring area is a bit small - especially if you are bleary-eyed in the morning. The water-pouring area is only about an inch wide and maybe a couple inches long. Compared to my old Mr. Coffee, which was about 6 inches by 4 inches, at least. One feature that does not seem to be mentioned often is the ""auto clean"" feature, where the coffee maker must have some sensor that determines when the calcification buildup gets too thick. I have not had occasion to see it work yet, but it is a cool feature. I also like the ""gold tone filter"" - makes for filter conservation (not GOLD, just GOLD TONE - what is that all about?). All that said - this machine makes a decent cup of coffee.",1

I saw Kraftwerk on their recent USA tour, and this DVD brought it all back, and better. The surround mix wasn't part of the US tour, at least in Seattle. The mix is even. I hate crowd noise during the music on most live albums, but this is minimal. The occasional surround effects aren't overdone, either. The best part of the show is the clean projections behind the quartet, and on this DVD they are edited in, so you get the clean graphics on your screen. I only wish this was available on blu-ray so the graphic parts were sharper. Highly recommended if you like Kraftwerk and have a surround system.",1
"Nice Design, very disappointing longevity.

I bought this drill because I liked the design. The ergonomics are excellent and it feels like a quality unit. Unfortunately, it has not lived up to my expectations. The switch failed after less than a year, and Bosch kindly replaced the entire drill rather than repairing it. Now, however, the batteries are failing and they are just barely past their 18 month warranty limit, and of course a pair of new batteries cost nearly as much as the whole drill kit. I have a DeWalt 9.6v drill that's about seven or eight years old, and its original batteries are stronger than the Bosch's which are one-fifth as old. I understand that Bosch has bumped up the warranty on newer batteries to 2 years, but that's cold comfort to me.",0

Pam Anderson is such a self-effacing Hollywood commodity that I foolishly expected more from this book...at least some humor or insight into the self-manufactured showbiz machine she has become. Instead, this is a hopelessly dull and pointless waste of time without even a satirical or titillating plotline to make you want to turn the page. It actually IS a book you can put down. It doesn't manage to fall into the category of beach reading, although you might want to throw it in the ocean.Pam deserves better....Her co-writer could have come up with something more Jackie Collins-esque. Was the BAYWATCH babe playing it too safe, trying to straddle the fence between sexpot and respectable author? I think probably so. Too bad for her readers and/or fans. If the subject matter weren't so distasteful, it would suit the pre-teen girl demographic but instead it is just a story adrift.",0

To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so ""no child is left behind"" this book is a starting point about how people learn.

Unlike those who consider brain research a ""fad"", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of ""accountability"" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in ""leveling the field"" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of ""survivalists of poverty"".

I bought this CD to hear what Ben Zander had to say about the two symphonies recorded (it comes with a free cd of him discussing the symphonies). It is quite interesting to hear the tempos he brings to two of Beethoven's most famous symphonies. The sound is great on these recordings (as I have come to expect from Telarc), but I don't know what I think of the interpretations yet. They are quite different from what we have become used to (i.e. Karajan, Furtwangler), but they do offer a new and curious insight to Beethoven. I'd recommend this recording so you can have a different experience of Beethoven.",1

""Robert Bresson: A Spiritual Style in Film"" by Joseph Cunneen is a much-needed introduction to a master film director. Cunneen, long-time movie critic for the ""National Catholic Reporter,"" approaches Bresson's career in a way that easily explains the director's distinctive approach to cinematography.Bresson rejects the artificiality and dependence of ""photographed theater"" with it's reliance of star performers and instead emphasizes an austere, elliptical approach to narrative, making a masterful use of natural sound.Cunneen explores all 13 films of Bresson in chronological order, clarifying the development of Bresson's technique while making clear that his ""spiritual style"" is why Susan Sontag called him ""the master of the reflective model in film.""Easily understood by the novice as well as the movie buff, this book should send readers hunting down Bresson movies in the better video stores, and begging local universities to stage retrospectives of Bresson's entire oeuvre.",1

His writing is inspiring and challenging and speaks to the deep places of both mind and heart of one who is on a quest for Truth to live by. One reading is not enough. It will be a part of my studies for years to come.",1
"Amazing Movie!! Matt Damon Step Aside!!

This deviation from Bourne Matt Damon) with Jeremy Renner playing as a more advanced operative and the new LARX operation is very mysterious and alluring. I really hope they continue along this story line. Jeremy Renner plays the part of Aaron Cross with style and finesse that Matt Damon doesn't have. I can't wait to see more of this great intriguing story. I would love to see Renner play Scott Ambler as well too if they ever get around to writing a screenplay to it.This is a bargain at the price it's being offered at as well.",1
"A delightfully melancholy journey

This ""best of"" album nicely showcases Browne's progression through the years, from his highly personal early work through his more outwardly focused and often political music. Overall, I enjoyed the album, because the song choices often coincided with my favorites from particular albums. For example, ""Sky Blue and Black"" and ""The Barricades of Heaven"" are the two best from their respective albums. It is a shame, though, that music does not seem to have been chosen this way consistently; some, like ""Running on Empty"" and ""Somebody's Baby"" (while, granted, good songs) seem to have been included more for recognizability than artistry and stick out oddly among the more pensive-sounding tunes that populate this recording. One caveat: Jackson's best work is excellent, but often his best work is also wrenchingly melancholy. This makes it hard to sit down and listen to ""The Next Voice You Hear"" at a stretch without sinking into a deep melancholia yourself. Be warned!",1

"Great gospel movie

The Gospel of John was a powerful movie acted out using the Good News Bible. It did well in showing Jesus' passion and brought alive how shocking some of His teaching was to those who heard Him. I'm not used to the translation, so some of the verses seemed off from what I expected, but it was good in that it was easy to understand and follow. I praise God that He uses movies to give a greater idea of how these events took place!",1

"Cher - Not,com.mercial

From what I understand Cher was self-conscious about this CD because she had a hand in writing all the songs , hence the limited distribution. Although not her best album, it contains a Cher classic, ""Still"". The CD should be added to your collection for this cut alone.A sidebar: I discovered ""Still"" on a p2p and I would have never known the story behind the recording without the Internet. How can I say this nicely? The recording slimeballs should remove their collective heads from their dark, dank nether regions, and understand that the net is responsible for more sales than it takes away.",1

"Don't bother

I was excited to read this book as I has heard that it was a ""smarter"" Da Vinci code. I am sorry to say that I was pretty dissapointed. The characters didn't feel very real to me, they all seemed to be exceedingly uptight and the relationships amongst them didn't feel genuine. I can appreciate and respect that these guys had lofty academic pursuits that extended beyond nightly keggers and stupid pranks, but I was left with an impression of Princeton as a boring military state for the priveleged.It is interesting to learn about the Hypnerotomachia, but not enough to merit reading this book.",0
"Just regular folks ..gone wrong

Not all HOllywood high rollers are born cool and ultra-confident. This book documents that fact and proves it, as it walks us through the rise and fall of one of Hollywood's finest. This book gets down to earth and tells the story of a young woman born into a middle class family in NY (where else?!) who rapidly rises to the heights of success and fame in her profession and spirals down, almost as rapidly. Truth is always more intersting than fiction and this book proves it.",1
"Between begginer and serious but lost the focus

In my opinion this is a book built arround a very good example of an application, but not a book to start with nor a book for the experts.The introduction goes fast jumping from subject to subject without showing a clear direction to teach you either logic, approach, language, conventions or how to better understand the environment (developing environment)The fact of talking about visual basic makes me think instantly that there will be a smooth transition till you are up to speed and then jump to more complex examples, in this book it is a collection of picks and tricks in a messy way in order to prepare you without too much explanation so they can explain ""real"" application written in VB.Funnily the application itself is very informative and useful but by the time you arrive there there are too many questions running wild on your head and is quite fustrating.",0

"Brilliant Album-This Is An Essential Recording For Any Jazz Fan

This 1959 session pairs Ben Webster, one of leading tenor sax players of his day, with the incomparable Oscar Peterson Trio. The end result is excellent.Ben Webster is often overlooked today but, in his day, he was one of the best, and best known, tenor sax players. He played in the Duke Ellington band before going on to a successful career as a soloist and session player. As examples of Webster's session work, check the credits on Billie Holliday's best known albums and you'll find Ben Webster's name there.Webster had a very distinctive, breathy style of playing. He always wanted to learn the lyric of a song before performing it so he could use the phrasing of the lyric in his playing. If you're not familiar with Ben Webster, this album is a great introduction.Bottom line: if you like 1950s jazz, this is an essential album for your collection.",1

"Golden Globe Award Deserves Closer Look!

I had the pleasure of seeing John Hartford perform at the ""Spring Fling"" in Winfield, Kansas circa 1976. Golden Globe Award was the song he did that just stuck with me. A lot of people might think that an odd choice but I have always believed that it takes a genius to use humor in music without being trite.Golden Globe Award is really a song about APPRECIATING something in your life. Hartford had the courage to be both whimsical and deep. How many pop artists write songs about appreciating anything? The Steamboat Captain is certainly missed in today's waters.",1

It tells us Mr. Carville believes in ""our way or no way"" politics rather than compromise and pragmatism.

"Good, Concise History of Canada

Many Americans know little about the history of their northern neighbour (for example, how many of you knew that Newfoundland was a British protectorate until 1949?). This volume shows how Canadian history transpired from the nineteenth century to the turn of the twenty-first century. The author examines economic, political, and social events, as well as foreign policy--he presents a Canadian perspective on the U.S. Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. Morton goes into detail about Canadian elections down to the breakdown of seats by party in Parliament, and the author shows how many of the social trends in America in the latter half of the 20th century also took place in Canada. Those who wish to get a basic understanding of Canadian history would do well to read Desmond Morton's informative history.",1
"Good, quick read - not his best work.

Well if you are expecting Andromeda Strain or Jurrasic Park (or even Sphere) you will probably be dissapointed. The science in Timeline is weak at best, and you never really buy the ""alternate universe to the past"" bit (not to mention how they explain the way the team gets reconstituted on the other end). The history is a little better and the story is rather exciting from an action standpoint.I kept thinking about ""Doomsday Book"" by Connie Willis as a much better rendition of an amazingly similar theme and plot line (i.e. history researcher going back in time to the middle ages, having technical problems, having to use their history knowledge to survive, etc.). If you read Timeline, read Doomsday Book as well for a nice comparison.",0

In over 25 years of being a Christian, I have never heard this before. I have often struggled with feeling guilty because I didn't move to a foreign land.

"Nice try but not quite

If you've read ""Illusion"" you know what I mean. The book is good, I like the settings of 18th century India at the time of the British settlement that were used as inspiration of the story, but the characters were too bidimensional. You never quite got to know them deep inside, its as if they're just actors playing a role, very unlike ""Illusion"" were you could feel the passion and see the souls of the characters. And the secondary characters were used as fillers, just to make it look complex. But even so, it's not boring, it's as deep a reading as the previous books and its quite entertaining, but it didn't leave me thinking like Illusion did at the end, which by the way was pretty easy to find out. But these are only my opinions, and I encourage people to find out by themselves, as I did with Illusion, which is still my favorite. This one might turn out to be yours.",0

"How to pay four times the price for what book is worth.

This book on Theravada Buddhism was obviously written by remnant hippies from the 1960's. Anything stated within it can be gleaned from a hundred other sources on the subject matter which is probably what they did, and then decided to market it at the outrageous price of $37 in order to support whatever lifestyle they might have. The marketing blurb for the book is probably worth more than the book itself which should retail for around $8.Here are the names of three other texts on Theravada Buddhism which are worth every cent of their purchase price, and each of which are priced well below $25.""What the Buddha Taught"" by Walpola Rahula.""Theravada Buddhism"" by Richard Gombrich.""Love and Sympathy in Theravada Buddhism"" by Harvey B.

"""The Lord Gave & The Lord Has Taken Away""

""Job: A Masque for Dancing"" is one of the greatest pieces that Vaughan Williams has ever composed. It's a forty-minute ballet piece that tells of Job being tested by both God & Satan. The music itself is made for a large Wagnerian orchestra that includes an organ, xylophones, a saxophone, and an alto flute. There are lots of complex orchestrations here; not very Stravinsky-like, but more in the likes of Liszt and Wagner. ""The Lark Ascending"" is a favorite for many RVW fans, and it sounds beautiful. It has a pure English feel to it, and the solo violin should not be ignored.This CD by Naxos has surprisingly great audio. The bass and treble are perfect, though ""Lark"" does have a bit of a low volume when compared to the volume of ""Job"". David Lloyd-Jones and the English Northern Philharmonia (which is part of Opera North) do an incredible job with both pieces. This is one flawless CD that I'll keep unti lthe last years of my life.A+",1

"unintentional (?) camp

Because I feel technical/craft deficiencies sink this film, I'm not going to commment on the plot, except to say that the several storylines were not very well integrated. Some bits and pieces of this movie made me wonder what the actors could have achieved with better direction and a better script, but far too often their emotions changed so dramatically and unrealistically within a scene that is was imposible to take them seriously. The music was sappy and distracting, playing so heavily over some scenes as to make the dialogue difficult to understand. It was refreshing to see ""real"" looking actors but what they were given to say was many times laugh-out-loud silly and trite. Not the worst movie I've seen, but one easily skipped.",0

"A new take on a classic!

After listening to this cd for the first time I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be thinking. Many of my initial reactions were""What was that?!"" ""No they didn't!"" ""How could they?!""After listening to it again I really enjoyed it. For the Jekyll and Hyde purists out there, you'll hate it! For anyone open to new ideas and new interpretations, you'll love it! Robert Evan is a voice from the Broadway show itself (I saw him as Jekyll), and both woman have powerful voices that, in my opinion, do all of the songs justice. The only thing I couldn't handle was ""The World Has Gone Insane."" I think they took that one a little too far with the heavy metal! But aside from that, there are a lot of embellishments and guitar riffs, but it's a good cd!",1

Has anyone ever heard 50 Cent and G-UNIT rap live? Obviously not, or you wouldn't even be considering buying this CD.

"Too bad the ratings do not go negative!

Other than special effects, I find nothing memorable about this film. The misinterpretation of historic fact borders on the hysterical, and to some degree almost criminal. The film does a diservice to all those who perished in the attack, and especially those who survived and fought to keep America free. For those who are interested in Pearl Harbor, and are looking for a more accurate portrayal, get Tora Tora Tora. This movie should die a unlamented death.",0

That's just it ... Lame. Take a simple story with foreseeable twists (the twists are mainly due to vagueness) and squeeze it for as much lamey juicy stuff as you can get. Mmmm, mmm, good.

For the most part I'll never get the time back and what time was worth while could have been used elsewhere.",0

I have tried the disc and graphics card in multiple computers and still the same result. Called customer service, and they said I could not exchange or return it because I opened it.

I was predisposed to agree with Mr. Wanjek -- I bought the book for ammunition.

Here's the killer tip - don't get this book. It proves you can get anything published if you come up with a good title.

Ooo, wow! Flash's built in online help covers every topic here without the trouble of thumbing through this waste of paper. And the author's overbearing self-absorbed tone makes it all the worse.

"Drive failed after six months; Memeo auto-backup software very buggy

This is quite literally the worst electronic product I've ever purchased.I loved my FreeAgent for the first 30-60 days, but after reading the Seagate Memeo automatic backup software's log file, I realized there were many, many backup failures happening due to bugs in Memeo. Support sent a new release, and this fixed some of the more egregious errors. But a few weeks later I added 1GB of new files to my computer and Memeo only backed up the folders, not the files in those folders, and stayed completely quiet about its failure.

This is the first book which I have purchased concerning shipwrecks. I expected many photographs with information concerning the wrecks.

Yeah, I'm agree with Christopher's review. The only other thing I'd add besides Big Black meets Black Flag- is a touch of Fugazi and for some reason Unsane. There's a hint of industrial but not in that oversaturated sampling of later industrial of the late 90's early 00's- but more like the organic noises of Neaubauten. Definetly would recommend to the fans of the bands mentioned above. And for the music trivia people- yes London May of Samhain plays drums on this record...",1

"Good all around prayer book

This book is very good if you're unable to, don't want to, or don't know how to, compose your own prayers. There's prayers for almost any occasion or life circumstance, and they are very good. Besides prayers, there's Martin Luther's thoughts on the sacraments, such as baptism.On the negative side, which is the reason why I didn't rate the book another star, an awful lot of prayers in the section that offers morning and evening prayers seem to be variations on the same few topics, i.e., asking for forgiveness for shortcomings, thankfulness for living to see another day. Like a great many other prayer books, none are targetted for different life stages. I say this as a shortcoming, because in my own prayer life, I find that at age 54 I'm praying for different things than I did at age 15 or 25. Of course, there's nothing to stop you from using any of the prayers as a starting point that you can add to. I've recently started doing that myself.",1

"Ozzy's Most Underrated.

No Rest For the Wicked has to be one of the most underrated albums in metal. After Randy Rhoades death, he was replaced by Jake E Lee but he left the band also. Zack Wylde was the new guitarist and Ozzy took a new direction, however this was before his comeback with No More Tears that put him back into the limelight. No Rest For the Wicked is the heaviest of his '80s discography. It's also very fast paced and upbeat, in my opinion Zack Wylde's a lot better guitarist than Jake E Lee or even Randy Rhoades. No Rest For The Wicked was almost forgotten and it only had one minor hit, ""Miracle Man"". ""Demon Alcohol"" and ""Tattooed Dancer"" are my personal favorites. It's not my absolute favorite or probably not even in my top 5 but it's a step up from his last 2 albums and a good underrated gem, it's only a sign of things to come.",1

I opted for these shocks for my 2005 Outback XT even though they are for the 2000 - 2004 MY. The earlier OB's are about 600lbs heavier thus the shocks have more aggressive valveing. Subaru missed the mark on the rear shock valveing for these cars and this shock seems to have made up the difference. I combined them with the Rallitek overload springs.

"Everglades a nice return to a series I had abandoned

I have been a fan of Randy Wayne White since I first read his columns in Outside magazine. I loved the early books in the Doc Ford series, but felt that they took a dark and offensively misogynist turn somewhere around North of Havana. I stopped reading them after The Mangrove Coast. I joked to a friend that the author must be going through a nasty divorce or something, because he seemed to have a compelling need to torture, maim, and/or kill every female character in his books. However, a friend who shared my love of the early books and has continued to read the subsequent books, gave me a copy of Everglades, saying that she thought I would like this one. She was right. I did like it. And I especially appreciated that the main female character didn't die, or lose a limb, or become permanently disfigured. I liked it enough that I'm going to give the author's latest book, Tampa Burns, a try.",1

It has been over a decade since this was last released so the prices were sky high for used copies. I finally gave up trying to get one and took my kids to go see the new Tron movie. How a company like Disney came to make the decision to release this after the new Tron movie was in theaters is beyond me.I will definately buy this to show my kids when it comes out so the new Tron movie will make more sense. The original Tron movie was way ahead of its time with an interesting plot line and cool special effects that were ahead of its time. Of course the special effects will look dated by today's standards but back in the day the movie inspired many other shows.",1

"A must for professional photographers!

This book is excellent. It's written in a way that makes it easy for us ""common folks"" to understand and also to explain to our clients. The information offered is extremely valuable, full of legal insight and advice for constructing your own contracts, and the sample forms are fully explained and are very easy to alter for a business' specific needs.I also recommend ""Wedding and Portrait Photographers' Legal Handbook by Norman Phillips and Christopher S.

"Works great

This box cost a fair amount but if you shop around you can get a real bargain.The consPlacement: it is big so finding the right spot can be difficult, it need so be hooked to a toilet or near your washing machine. The supplies are not availble in many retail stores in fact there are none in my town so gues what mail order(buy in bulk and save)The Pros; it works well and they have greatly improved it since the first model, it is I believe less expensive than a regualr litter box and other than the ocassional cleaning it is self sufficient, but when you do clean it it can be a chore. Yes it can stink too if poop gets cooked in the hopper, just like any ohter box you need to clean it.Basically there is no such thing as a perfect box this one can be programed and is very elf sufficient but it has issues just ilke other, butif you hate scooping this is for you.",1
"Tamarac 3536 Express is awesome!

I chose this bag for NOT looking like a camera bag. While it's not as stealth as hoped, it still is a good looking bag. Plenty of room for Canon Rebel Xti and zoom, plus gadgets - Velcro dividers make it completely customizable. I like the side pocket for cell phone. Zippered compartment on flap is great for tickets, etc. Only drawback is the fact that it isn't waterproof, but the heavy bag it comes in works nicely for setting it down on wet bleachers. Handle on top is very convenient.",1
"Helped a lot!

My neutered 4 year old tuxedo cat had out of nowhere started peeing on our leather couch in the cracks between the cushions. I chewed him out the first time I saw him do it and cleaned up the pee with white vinegar and water. I keeping an eye on him when he did head for the litter box and I noticed he was having difficulty peeing, actually straining and then only releasing a dime size amount of pee. I took him to the vet to find out he had that dreaded problem that MANY neutered male cats get where they get crystals in their urine and have stones and problems passing urine. That is why he had started peeing on the couch. After a huge vet bill and a change in his diet to food that made specifically for maintaining a healthy urinary tract he improved on going in the litter box. I recommend this product to anyone who has had a problem with their cat suddenly peeing in a place they never had before. It worked for us!",1

"Do Not Purchase, Period

This is the sort of product where you realize you've been had as soon as you try to use it. It's priced at about [...], just enough that it's just about too much trouble to spend your time going to take it back. The lights lit up for about one second when I plugged it in, and then they were dead for good. Note that the lights have no switch -- the only way to turn the lighted mirror on and off is to unplug it, and that's if it actually works. Which it doesn't. The include replacement bulbs, but as ALL of the lights were dead, that was not the problem. Furthermore, there weren't nearly enough bulbs to replace the entire thing. Moreover, if you try to remove the case to change a bulb, using a coin as the directions tell you, you basically destroy the case, which is made of soft plastic that scratches and bends immediately. Take my word for it -- don't buy this. It's a scam item, in my opinion.",0
"Rip off

This radio is advertised as one of the best around. I fell for the hype and I want to warn you that it is full of flaws. 1) reception was no better than my small Sony radios. 2) The sound is supposedly balanced for talk radio. To me, it sounds muffled (as if everyone is talking out of a cave) with few highs. Yuck. 3) There is no handle, just a grab indentation. A radio this big is sure to drop with nothing to hold onto. Yes, they do sell a carry case - one that makes the whole thing as ugly as can be. 4) The buttons have to be pushed down hard to change. An individual defect on the one I got? Who knows? 5) This is very expensive for a whole lot of nothing. Don't be taken in. Get a Grundig field radio or a Sony instead. I regret my purchase.",0

I liked ""Lucky You"", and ""Lucky 6"" is excellent as well. But, it's something with which you must experiment first.

The books are magnificent and the Canadian mini-series Anne of Green Gables and Anne Of Green Gables The Sequel (Anne of Avonlea) were really good and Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie were great as Anne and Gilbert but when I sat down to watch The Continuing Story I was very, very, very disappointed with this boring clunker of a movie! I really agree with the reviewer who said she felt like the director threw out the books and came up with some action and adventure war movie! Gone is the charm, the wit and sophistication of the books and the previous entries in this movie trilogy and I can't recommend this disappointing movie to anyone! Also what was with them trying to make that this movie only took place a short time after Anne of Avonlea when it's so obvious that the actors have aged a lot since that time, especially Megan Follows.",0

I assume you're interested in this book because it's a shortcut: we hear that a business can be undermined by [initially] unattractive innovations, aka the innovator's dilemma.

The proposal is to create small business units, since the initial returns will be small, then make sure they rapidly become _profitable_.

"The Most Complete History of the Bielski Brothers

Duffy certainly did his research. His book is the most complete and accurate account of the Bielskis I have read. His descriptions of each of the brothers who were ""partisans"" during the German invasion and occupation of Belarus from 1941 through 1944 are what I have known and read in other histories of Russia and Germany during that time period. The book is most often written chronologically...and when it skips to a different time period, the reader is made aware of this. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the German occupation of Soviet territories during WWII; the carnage of Jews by the Nazi ""Final Solution;"" the Bielski family, in particular the 4 brothers who survived and helped countless other Jews to survive in the forests; and the Soviet/Russian partisans who played a vital role in driving the Germans out of Belarus, Lithuania and Poland.",1

"An excellent place to start reading Murakami

""After the Quake"" is an excellent entry point for Murakami. The short story collection is brief and gives the reader a sense of the author's style before tackling something lengthier and more challenging. The collection links characters distantly impacted by the 1995 Kobe earthquake, people who can't face their own internal fractures. Murakami explores his recurring themes, including: going underground, Oedipal complexes, inspiration taken from nature and music, UFOs and very ""reality based"" surreal happenings, like a giant talking frog who shows up in the kitchen of a mild-mannered desk-jockey enlisting him to help save Tokyo from destruction. These stories are also linked by a loss of identity and the urgent desire to be free, whether from a failed relationship, religion, responsibility or one's own lost dreams.

Cage's ""Sonatas & Interludes"" go back to when he was actually composing music instead of rolling dice.

Some pieces hark back to Webern, some look ahead to Glass, others sound like gamelan or a Cuban percussion section.

I also listened to the audio recording and I agree that the story was fine but I also agree that the narrator's lack of British accents was a bit odd. Why would a company put out British Historicals and Regencies on audiobook and not use a narrator who has a British accent? They should rerelease this and use a British narrator or find someone who knows how to put one on and another thing is that this book has been extremely abridged on this tape, it is only one tape and approximately ninety minutes so though I love listening to audiobooks I also love to read and I would recommend you buy paperback or hardcover editions instead so you will get the full story. Why an unabridged audiobook with a British narrator was never issued I have no idea why!",0
"Hip Hop Hagiography

Rarely have I encountered such an awkward and opaque writing style. Desmond uses the sampling techniques of hip-hop, producing sentences by stringing together various quotes and quote fragments. The result manifests neither rhythm nor flow as the reader must laboriously decode even the shortest sentences. The overall result is that the book which although it has fair to good factual and analytical content has a fragmentary feel about it and is in general a chore to read.",0
"Vibration,burning brushes,so much JUNK

I used a Craftsman unit identical to this one, and the first problem was the screws working loose,leaving the motor spinning when it became disconnected from the piston.After taking it apart and putting the screws back in,it worked fine ....for a while. A short while.Upon topping off tire pressures on my truck,it acted as though the voltage suddenly was cut by half.Then it started smoking,and air pressure dropped to nil.I took it apart again,and ran it with no load.The brushes on the motor were sparking and burning,it appears the brush holders are very cheaply made and don't last.I suppose this is an inexpensive inflator, but for the money you'd probably be better off spending $50.00 for a brick.",0

This is a collector volume I would buy again or recommend to someone....all the movies were good...I especially like the movie ""Borrowed Hearts"" and have watched at least 8 or 9 times. My husband really enjoys the movies as well...very tender, great story, excellent cast...a must see!The other three were great too and a ""Hobo's Christmas"" had excellent cast as well...very great ending and definitely for the whole family. A great movie to watch year after year..Dennis Rainey plays such a good part and in reality many of us have experienced problems in our families as well....wait till the end...it's a neat story that really gets to your heart...I liked this movie!The ""Man who saved Christmas""...well this story is such a neat story...no wonder it's true! What a heart for children and much less Christmas...anyone watching this would have to most likely really like this story...a surprise ending brings this story to the real meaning of Christmas! I loved it.!",1

"Pseudo-science

This is an important subject that deserves a study that is impartial, objective, and in the spirit of scientific inquiry. This book is none of these things.After padding many pages with case histories that could be found anywhere, the author finally makes it clear that his definition of a psychopath is anyone of whose beliefs, philosophy, or artistic endeavors he disapproves.He repeatedly uses pseudo-scientific language to rationalize his prejudices. The highly judgmental tone of this book makes it worthless as a serious study.",0
"Good for semi-professional use

I bought these headphones as a present to myself for graduation. I use them primarily for casual jazz listening and hip hop music production/turntablism. I am not, repeat, not an audiophile. However, I do know when I have a good pair of head phones. I can wear these babies for a couple hours without discomfort, and when they do start to hurt, I simply move them back a little farther on my head. Sound canceling/leakage is excellent. The pads cut out most external sound and keep it from leaking out. The cord is a nice length, and the ability to replace just the cord and not the whole headphone will probably come in handy in the near future.The bass on these bad boys is amazing, perfect for listening to hip hop, funk, soul, or anything with a driving bass line. I have already noticed several complex bass lines i missed using other headphones. I don't know how well these work for audiophiles, but for a semi-casual user, they are perfect.",1
"Not too shabby

The Revlon waver isn't too bad of a product considering that it's only $20. The waver produces nice waves, but only when used with hair wax or a wet-effect spray so that the waves don't look too frizzy. The iron is extremely heavy, is awkward to hold, doesn't heat up very quickly and isn't very hot so it's a pain to hold the HEAVY iron in place for at least twenty seconds for each section to have the waves set. I have very fine hair and not too much hair, so if this iron takes a long time to do my hair, I imagine it will take much longer for people with coarser hair. The iron doesn't have tourmaline plates so your hair doesn't look shiny and is easily damaged. Pros: the waves stay tight and looks the same as when you first ""waved"" your hair even after a day.",0

"Boring, lackluster film by lazy animators...

At the point this film was made (early '70's) the animation staff had become so enamoured by the sterling quality of their own drawings that they forgot that maybe they should tell a story. This film has a lot of plot, but not a lot of story--and while the voices add a certain amount of bounce to the proceedings, they aren't given a whole lot to do other than mug to the mike. As Disney goes, it's right down there in the bottom of the barrel with Black Cauldron and Pocahontas.",0
"Defective productive, horrible customer service

The low price doesn't offset the many problems. The unit is unable to locate a satellite in sufficient time, to the extent that you end up waiting for 10 minutes or more to start your workout. The heart rate function works about 50% of the time. The watch interface is unwieldy, requiring that you acknowledge many superfluous messages with an enter click. Worst, the watch now blue-screens my brand new expensive desktop PC every time I try to upload data.....Months later, the heart rate function has stopped working entirely. Contacting customer service has been a hassle. They have been slow to respond and rude, as they imply that I have abused the watch, and are charging me $33 to ship it back. I have gone back to using my earlier Nike watch, much simpler but at least its reliable. Garmin sucks.",0

"The STAR is this book!

I had been looking for interesting books for my 8 yr old son. This book was referred to me by his Teacher and boy did she nail it! It is very challenging to get my son to read different genre books because he is only interested in 'Animal' books. I've tried to introduce many different books that did not hold his attention. If the book didn't have an animal in the title or a picture of an animal on the cover, he was generally not interested. Well, this book changed all of that! His instruction is 20 minutes of reading every night - well, he read this book in its entirety the first night! He didn't want to put it down because he was really enjoying the characters and the storyline. Since then, he's more apt to reading 'other' books and seems to enjoy them also. All I can say is...thank you Mrs. Pina and thank you Candice F. Ransom!!",1

If you type his name into a search engine, such as Google, you'll find his website, which also lists his phone number.

"Best of the small automated scopes

Both Celestron and Meade have come out with scores of automated scopes in the last few years, and of the 5"" and smaller scopes, the Nextstar 5 is the clear winner. It's large enough and optically fine enough to deliver a sharp image at magnifications of up to 250x, and bright enough to resolve thousands of dim objects. For lunar viewing it's first rate. Quality wise it's somewhat better built than the similar Meade scopes, with fewer plastic pieces.You can buy smaller scopes with automation, but when shopping atthe inexpensive end of the market, it's better to put your money into optics instead of automation. But if you can budget over a thousand dollars, and you're looking for an automated scope, this is the clear choice.",1

"Treadmill section good

I would rate it 5 stars for the treadmill section but it is only half of the tape (30 minutes). There are two instructors, one that leads you through the running, jogging and walking on the treadmill and the other that works with the hand weights while you walk on the treadmill. Both are good. Their speed and incline is much higher than I can do but of course you only go as fast and/or as high as you feel safe. Advanced would probably jog as fast as they do and maybe use greater incline... When I was finished with that portion, I was sweating and somewhat panting. After the 30 minutes they move on to exercises with weights, away from the treadmill. I would rather use another of my tapes after the first thirty minutes. The two women aren't as exciting during the last half hour.",1

"The Next Matchbox 20

After listening to this album I found that this album had a familiar feeling; The Calling sound a lot like Matchbox 20 on this release. That would be bad but they sound like the better version of Matchbox 20. There are the rock overtones but this heads right down the middle of the Adult Contemporary aisle while still sounding good. Now this oculd be bad news if you absolutely loved the band's sound before but if you're a fan of the band and not just their sound you'll be saitsfied. As for me I don't necessarily like this sound because there are so many bands that go here. I'd prefer some newer bands that are trying something a little new like Interpol, Stellastarr or Snow Patrol. At least this album is good for what it is.",1

I read some of the other reviews before I submitted this. I don't see how someone could get upset over the liner notes.

Redd has one of the best tones I've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers. Ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar? Well, you won't get that on this CD because Redd doesn't play something to just play it. This CD showcases Redd's versatility from country, to swing, to blues, to rock, it has it all.

I purchased this book for my about-to-be 4th grader. I liked the format of everything written in the first person-i.e. each of the four characters writes a narrative. The plot ended up being a little thin and the ending was a let down.My biggest objection was the multiple uses of the word ""sucks"" and at least one ""freaking"" (as a substitute for the ""F"" word). Maybe it's acceptable for teens to use these words on a regular basis but I didn't feel it was appropriate for a 9 year old. I discontinued this book with my kids after 2 chapters for this reason. Call me old fashioned but I just thought other parents might like to know the content.As other reviewers have mentioned, the treatment of the war was a little much for this age as well.",0

"Broke after a few months of use

I was very happy with this basic sound card until the color-coded plastic insulation for the sound-out jack broke into pieces and fell away. Not sure exactly how it happened. I do plug and unplug connectors into the jacks a lot so I guess the plastic insulation wasn't strong enough for that. On closer inspection, the plastic does seem to be the hard, brittle kind. I think a softer plastic is needed here. Anyway, the card is now unusable. I can make a connection, but I get a lot of noise and feedback without insulation around the plug. All of this happened after only 4.5 months of use. No idea if the manufacturer will replace it. Aside from this one problem, it was a perfectly acceptable sound card.",0

North Shore is definitely a cult surf film. Although it is a bit unrealistic, it was a surf film so unline other surf films in the 80's (everyone remember ""Under the Boardwalk"").

I also recommend this to people who want to learn about the life of feudal Japan. This book is about a boy named Muna, a boy looking for his father. Dreaming about how his father looks like. He lives on the information that his father is a samarai warrior. He looks for a sign of the chrysanthemum. He sneaks on a ship.",1
"Sweet Jazz

This is great jazz. Simple in instrumentation (drums, bass, flute, ukulele); and yet very rich and style and sound. It is smooth jazz with the phenominal stylings and skill of Lyle Ritz! He was and is a pioneer in jazz uke.If you like good smooth jazz it is well worth the money. Ritz provides a stunning performance for a first album.",1
"Excellent after a little seasoning

I've found this chair to be very comfortable, even after long periods of time. It has a nice range of adjustablity.However, upon removing it from the box, the plastic housing that covers the tilt mechanism on the bottom of the seat. However, as this doesn't affect the function and isn't really visible unless you 12"" tall it wasn't a big enough issue for me to return it.My only real complaint about this chair is that for the first several days I had it, it was giving off fumes (think new car smell, only unpleasant). These fumes had a mildly unpleasant odor and were strong enough to give me a wicked headache and stomach nausea after 2-3 hours of sitting in the chair on the first day.My advice- after you assemble the chair douse it in febreeze and sit it in an unused corner of the room for a few days until the smell goes away. After that, it's a wonderful desk chair.",1
"Too many book like this in market for money

1. firstly, you can't make anyone fall in love with you.2. It's totally not necessary to please anyone like that.3. learn to love yourself, which is the best way that get idea relationship, otherwise you will attract the wrong person.4. Have you heard in many relationships, sex is good, but the relationship is bad? what the author tell us is ""how to get someone in bed"". If you want that, this is good reference.There is big difference between love and sex attraction5. when you attract the one like this, the result is he or she will be smart enough to find that you are lowing yourself to please him/her.( no one is as fool as that). What you get is pity NOT love.There is still some scientific information here, So I give 2 star, maybe can be used as reference for people who understand themselves.",0

So, this morning at 8:30 AM, I poured company coffee into my thermos (almost filled to the brim) and screwed the top on tight.

I received this product from my wife as a gift about a year ago. Actually really liked the machine once I learned the quirks of using it.

Just a stainless steel brick.Still have not heard what the issue is from Krups, or how much it will cost to fix.

In view of the fact that I've been getting a nice close shave with a twin blade razor and shaving oil for many years,I have been pleasantly surprised by the 9160Xl. The features that make this shaver special to me are how easy it cleans with water,how quiet it runs and the charge lasted over (3) weeks. The directions suggest shaving when your skin is dry and that works great for me.",1

I have been a huge fan of the Cox Family and Alison Krauss for many years and I can't get enough of them.

"Easy For Your Stomach

This book is both: a fascinating family life story starting in Poland, behind the Iron Curtain, miraculously emerging into the Open World to continue in pursuit of artistic dreams, and a treasure house of traditional Polish meals enriched during the voyage. The wisdom of the book lies in the combination of both elements based on very deep passion, humanity, peace and love; some of the feelings kept secretly in the bottom of hearts for a long time. Meals, arts, adversities of life, family, dreams, friendships and struggles - these ingredients surprisingly support each other during the years leading finally to the speak-out, which the book really is. You can find them all inside flavored with flavorsome photographs and delightful graphics.",1

"Breathtaking song

This is an awesome song, especially live. The song starts off simple enough- no bass, Benji playing open chords, Billy plucking some strings here and there, and Aaron using just a tamborine and the hi-hat. Then it kicks into the chorus, with an awesome melody, distorted guitars, bass, and great drumming. The lyrics are very poetic, and gives you a warm feeling inside. The song is about needing motivation to go on in life. The thing that really steals the show, though, is Benji's guitar solo which starts at 2:11 and ends at 2:36. The song ends with that signature, Good Charlotte explosive, uplifting feeling, and guest vocalist Jimmy from Jimmy's Chicken Shack does vocals towards the end of the song, and the melodies are once again perfect. This is probably my favorite song ever, don't pass up this song just because your afraid liking GC will ""hurt your image"" or whatever, just give it a chance.",1

I really enjoyed this book, however I couldn't give it a five because I didn't LOVE it. It is a great love story, I enjoyed the history that the author discussed with the women's movement, (how approriate right now with women't rights being threatened), but I just couldn't quite buy the ghosts writing letters....Besides that, I read the book in one sitting, I couldn't put it down, although again, I guessed the ""secret"" of the story early on....but the book is beautifully written, the characters are really well developed, and over all an interesting and unusual read.

Jenny didn't know it was not her fiance but her fiance's brother who she made passionate love to in the darkness? Come on!

It's extremely depressing to watch, because it's so badly written and directed. Seeing Janeane Garofalo in this tripe makes it especially painful as well. Knowing how articulate and intelligent she can be, it hurts to see her in this ""film"". Maybe she had bills to pay. She deserve better material, a lot better.

"Button Errors

I owned this mouse for a few days. I purchased this mouse for the number of buttons, the scrollball, and the beautiful design. Occasionally triggering the squeeze function accidentally I could live with, but it would regularly misread a right click as a left click. Not once or twice, here and there, but about half the time, a right click would register as a left click.I really appreciate the design aesthetic, I really do. I like having the single plastic shell, but it hampers the functionality to such an extent that I returned it. For the premium price, I'd expect to get a device that does everything it advertises and does it well. Maybe in the next generation.",0
"OK TV, lousy customer service

I have this for about 3 months. I use it mainly as computer monitor. Picture quality is good, but customer service is quite lousy. There is no firmware update or no plan for firmware update.

"Be careful

This fan won Maximum PC's Kick A$$ Award which is why I purchased it. Instructions to install are poor at best.

I had to use nuts that were supplied for a different processor and worked fine. However, it only cooled CPU by 1-2 degress at best.

"Feedback on The Naked Church

My husband and I have been struggling with the organized church. This book helped us put into perspective what we were feeling and experiencing, helping us to find direction in our confusion. It sorted out questions we were having and gave us direction for our future involvement with church. Also, finding that the desire we have for ""more"" is not some vague idea we were experiencing. It has substance in a deeper intimacy with our God and can be found on an individual basis. God's love became more real and experiential. Want a deeper walk into the heart of God? We suggest Wayne Jacobsen's book, The Naked Church.",1

"Not good

The problem with the other customer reviews here are that they are all by beginners who don't know any better. I ordered this book as a beginner and started to believe what the book was saying. Later, I searched for info about the book on the backgammon newsgroup. The overwhelming response from experts was that it is a horrible book for learning backgammon. Much of the info in the book SOUNDS like good advice, but is simply wrong. He makes the ""rollover"" rule that he introduces sound like a very common and accepted rule. That is just not the case. He also over-simplifies things and makes blanket statements that are only true some of the time. I would suggest finding a copy of Magirel's ""Backgammon"" instead.",0
"Disappointed

This was given to me as a gift and I was very pleased at first and then I put in a classic movie and got no sound after the introduction. I at first thought it was the disc so I returned it and then got another. The same problem. I finally called customer service and was informed that they were aware of the ""glitch"" and that they had a problem with the chip no being able to read the way certain audio tracks are laid out. This problem should be fixed in the next year. I was not pleased, as how would I know which disc would play and which would not? I returned it to the local store and got another brand and now I am much happier.It does have a great carrying case though.",0
"Awesome! Provides Cheap way to Hack the SoundDock

Like the previous post, this thing provides an easy and cheap way to solderlessly to hack an aux input for the Sounddock.I bought this and and a Belkin Speaker and Headphone splitter. (The Belkin splitter is needed in order to fit properly over the Shuffle plug on the device, but other cables/adapters might work.) I then removed the existing ipod stand plate? and plugged this in.I set the switch to speaker and plugged in one end of the Belkin adapter. Any input signal automatically activates the Sounddock. Now you have a fully functional female and male stereo headphone input for your SoundDock.-->Total cost ~$20-25 and no soldering required.

"It is a strain to look for the points

The underlying theses of seeking to integrate the gospel message with social justice, and to see Christ in those suffering, are so important and intriguing in themselves that it is unfortunate that Kenneth Leech presents points without developing them. The entire book is rather flat and puzzling. For example, he mentions the classic Greek saints who were ""fools for Christ"", without adding the essential parts of their stories that show their holiness - one wonders if insanity guaranteed the heavenly crown in itself. As both a devout Christian and a political liberal, I had expected to be enriched by this work. That goal was not fulfilled. Trying to figure out what Leech meant was tiresome.",0

In typical Tad Williams style, the first two hundred pages are very hard to get through. The story flows nicely, but it starts off slow.

Whatever you think you know about faeries? Forget it. Tad has come up with his own world, own rules and made it quite... logical.Very nice read. Not his best work, but when I was done I found myself wishing it was a series. If you like fantasy, you will like this book.",1
"The worst movie I have ever seen.

I usually shy away from discouraging others from watching a movie, because who knows what their taste is, right? But this was the biggest waste of my time I have ever experienced. It was so bad in every way, and not in a kitchy-b movie kind of way, just bad. They tried to make it looked home filmed, which just came off as cheap and bad. They had the same few actors commenting repeatedly, which was bad. Pauly's performance was so whiny and annoying that by the end of the movie I WANTED him to be dead. I would rather sit at the dentist's office getting my teeth drilled out with no painkillers than ever watch this movie again.",0

"An Excellent Introduction

This pamphlet provides a good introduction to the emperor Nero and the history of his reign. In less than 100 pages a good foundation for understanding the chief events of Nero's reign. We also gain some insights into his personality but this book is written as a history, not a biography. Hence the concentration is more focused on where Nero fits into the Julio-Claudian dynasty. So while not dealing with Nero in detail this slender volume admirably fills the role of primer to a fascinating period and a guide to further reading.",1

"Misleading the buyer

Vivaldi Greatest Hits by CBS Masterworks (LMLK 45810) misleads the buyer. The CD cover draws your attention to feature artists Pinchas Zukerman and the NY Philharmonic with Leonard Bernstein. This led me to think Vivaldi's Four Seasons must be performed by Pinchas Zukerman. In fact, he only performs the Summer part. A different violinist and different supporting musical group plays each season. There is no way you would know this without playing the CD or reading the inside notes.The second deception is that only part of the NY Philharmonic performs.What about the performances? The violinists who play the Four Seasons play with varying degrees of relaxation and pleasantness. It's far below the heart pounding pace that Nigel Kennedy sets. I prefer more energy, drive and bite.Elevator music anyone?",0
"Lots to offer. Take what you will.

Freemasonry describes itself as ""a science of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols"". This book is a clear example of that definition. All Masons, and even non-Masons, are free to make as much or as little of Freemasonry as they wish. MacNulty's Jungian approach is an interesting new expression of mystical Freemasonry. Deep mysticism or self searching, however, has never been of interest to the majority of Masons, who get a lot out of their Masonry in other ways.

"Not very useful

The first problem with this book, is that the pages measure 6.5 by 8.5. making it feel like a small telephone directory. The photographs show portions of rooms that are simply too miniscule to appreciate; the context in which they are situated is not displayed. I found myself frowning a lot and feeling somewhat baffled.Also, I question the relevence of including close-ups of flowers, or fruit, or a long blank wall with a tiny window at the end of it. It's very irritating. Also, most of these homes are apartments which feature ultra-contemporary furnishings - cupboards with no knobs, couches that look like surf boards, etc. Only a few of the homes could be described as cozy and inviting and they were the best pictures, in my opinion.Ultimately, the smallness of the pictures ruined it for me - I hate having to squint at a photo. A better book is the New Decorating Book (2002, I believe) by Better Homes & Gardens. A true feast for the eyes.",0

"Overall Great, But The Japanese Version.....

I've got to admit, this is one of the great animes if I ever seen one. Gundam Wing is so fresh and new(I mean no one got sick of the reruns)it delivers a punch to you. But I noticed something with the Japanese Version. If you look very closely you can see the genius at Bandai or Sunrise didn't put the subtitles when the charecters were speaking. You hear words first that the charecter speaks, then you see the subtitles. That annoyed me. But hey, no one's perfect. It was nice to hear the original voice for Heero, but before I got the DVD, people said in the Japanese version Quatre's voice sounded a bit like a child's. When the voice came on I was shocked. In the dub they have it so manly. And you finally get the lyrics to ""Total Communication"". Note: After The Shooting Star She Saw, the ending theme song looked like Relena was abusing animals.

I was fortunate I didn't follow this guidebook.After reading it, I was disgusted with the publisher and author.It's very obvious they didn't put enough effort in making this guide.Compared to the Japanese strategy guide (FFX-2 Ultimania), they really should be ashamed of themselves. The Japanese authors spent 10s of 1000s of hours replaying the game to make sure what they wrote are without any mistakes and contains ALL the information the readers need.But this book is not only full of mistakes, it's missing important information (such as a guide to the underground dungeon) and doesn't have enough references between chapters.It doesn't even tell you where to get each accessary or item, they just listed them, and pretend that's enough.Don't trust those descriptions on the back of the book, this guidebook will only misguide you.",0

""Route 66"" takes me right out on the highway and into the desert. ""Once in a While"" really expoits the stereo picture as it was definitely just coming out at that time.

"Lightness in the dark

Lamb's direction has increasingly turned melancholic over the years. From the upbeat of their debut self-titled album to the increasingly mellow What Sound, the duo returns with their fourth effort Between Darkness and Wonder which showcases Lou's vocals in that even greater splendour.Though many viewed the opening Darkness as a disjointed piece of burbles, I have quite enjoyed it for its many turns and twists, frequently reminiscent of Bjork. As one reviewer mentioned, this album is more heavily string-laden this time round, almost giving an acoustic feel sometimes, but Lou's voice never detaches from the songs. My favorite would be the slightly upbeat Please.I must admit I enjoyed this a little more than What Sound but more happily, Koch Records is willing to invest on a non-mainstream band who could have never seen the light in the US for not being megasellers!

"Nice overview pre/post Zepplin

Aside from the rarities on disc 2 which are nothing short of amazing,(I bet you thought Pat Benatar was the only one who recorded ""You better Run""!)the essay written by Mr. Plant offers an insight to how he went about recording these songs over the past 35 years. I've always found it fasinating to watch and listen how an artist grows over time. Some of the tunes here represent just that, listen to ""Ship of Fools"" and then listen to his cover of ""Louie,Louie"", not many could pull that off!!It's admirable that Plant pursued so many avenues of music and song since 1980. It would have easy to tour every year and belt out Zepplin tunes, but the music in this set shows that the road taken was the best.",1

"Loved it

I used this book constantly for the 1st 3weeks of breastfeeding. It was so helpful I can't imagine what I would have done without it. My baby had trouble latching on in the beginning, so I had to pump my milk, and the section on pumping was extremely helpful too. Once we got her breastfeeding again I used all the tips the book offered and we are now off to a great start.",1

This is my second Zen. They are so awsome they deserve a chance i thought. The first one (second gen) was dropped out of my pocket while on a movie vehical, still worked. Stepped on it, still worked.

I totally loved the thing for the 2 DAYS that it worked. I was just sitting, listening to my jams and the sound just... went off. The headphone jack randomly crapped out on me.

"The Goblin's Back, and he's Bad!

While the first appearance of the Ultimate Green Goblin was a bit disappointing, (it led to several fans accusing Mr. Bendis of 'bastardizing' the character, accusations not entirely unfounded; Norman Osborn was originally true to form, but the Goblin was severly lacking), this new encounter is sure to satisfy the most hardcore Goblin fans. Norman returns and threatens to ruin Peter's life, and kill his loved ones. He's also planning to assassinate Nick Fury, (Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.), and the guy's even brainwashing his own son! As one online reviewer put it, his badass level raises exponentially. How will Spider-Man combat the return of his greatest enemy, and how does Mr. Fury figure into all of this? You'll have to read it and find out!",1

"Bad bad bad bad bad

First off, I would like to say that I am an avid reader of historical romance. Every book I start I finish... except this one. I really tried to get through it, but the writing style was extremely hard to read. The conversation read like a forth grade english project. Meaning, that the main character used either Mr. Lord or Dr. Lord in every sentance.. even when it was just the two characters on the road together. It was boring and redundant to say the least. And a horse that has his own opinion?!?!? PUl-leaz! The main character seemed shallow and vain and completely unlikable. But to be fair.. iI only got to chapter 6 before I had to put this stinker away. I have read Danelle Harmon's books before and they aren't the most spectacular, but they arre much better than this one. Please don't waste you time, money or energy on this one...",0

I have always loved Nicolette Larson's music. I thought I would love a CD made in her honor. I like the music of many of the people who came together to peform the concert that the CD was made from. But, the performers just didn't live up to my expectations. Jimmy Buffet gave the best performance and he is not even one of my favorite performers. CSN sounded terrible. Their harmonies were off and Stills sounded intoxicated throughout his performances. A disappointment all around.",0
"Dr. Malcolm Hutchinson Ed.D

I first read this book in 1988 it has guided me often from then until now. Its clear ethics will give valueable insight to all who will apply its ageless principals regardless of their personal faith practice. Foster's blending of practical reality linked with bibical concepts leaves one thinking in new (old) ways that still make since in a world who's ethics seem to be changing daily; humanism like marxism will be soon forgotten, yet the insights exponded by Foster will continue to make a profound positive impact. Having taught Business ethics and philosophy I have found no better book to read.",1

I did not receive instructions with the unit as described by another buyer. I mounted it with the hardware included with the piece and although the three screws and anchors seem a little lightweight for the piece, it seems to be holding okay.",1
"A Spunky & Eccentric Debut.

I fully admit that I have not listened to new types of music in a long while. I'm a fan of 1960's & 70's British Rock & Motown. I did not care much for the music of the 1990's. In ""Whoa Nelly,"" she bares all in her songs. swirling melodies, & open emotions, give her tunes a blend of bossa nova & folk pop. Her restless vocals kept you listening, even though the repititions grew tiresome. She reminds me a little of the alternative music from the 1970's with a 1990's twist. I liked ""I'm Like A Bird & Turn Off The Light"" the most. She certainly sounds like an artist that has some staying power.",1

I guess they are going to redub the whole series. The producer must have been born without a spine. I'll pass on future sets.",0
"A Cheap Imitation

Save your money! This movie lacks Bradbury's fast-moving style. The movie drags by, due to such unnecessary additions as the narrator swimming naked and the ""relationship"" between the illustrated man and the witch. Steiger and Bloom are dimensionless in their portrayal of a variety of characters. I could not empathize with the characters as I had done with the book. I believe in literary license, but Smight's should be revoked!",0
"Disappointing, then a really awful climax

I thought the main character was different and sympathetic, but that the author was too heavy handed in her other characterizations. It really went quickly downhill in the climax, as the solution to the plot problem involves us suddenly believing that the super intelligent and powerful aliens are now as gullible as a bunch of 3rd graders.",0
"A pleasurable struggle

A sometimes difficult book, especially with all of the computer references that are included (which are not exactly my forte'). Still, it remains a very good book, for we get a good sense of the protagonist's being adrift in a new life. It is interesting how he tries to find some handhold on his world while mixed in with people who very nearly speak a whole other language than himself. I am always attracted to characters who are spiritually wounded, yet manage to summon the courage to continue on with their lives, as well as to tackle daunting tasks. However, this isn't one of those books that will leave you happy and fuzzy after the last page. Those of you who swear by a certain talk show host's club's selections may want to avoid this one. But, if you like giving your brain cells a bit of a workout, this work is definitely a good choice.",1

I normally have quite a bit to write about in a review, but in this case I can probably summarise by saying that I did enjoy it, but I'm not quite sure what to say about the end! Maybe there'll be a sequel that will clarify a thing or two.(I came across one online review outside Amazon that talks about the clever ending, at which point I thought oh good, now it'll get explained, but whoever wrote that article seems to have missed one point that doesn't match his explanation either.

"A Strange Masterpiece for 2000

I have never been a huge fan of Catherine Wheel, although I've always respected them. When I first heard this album a couple of months before it's release, I was converted. I was literally distressed about having to wait for it to come out. Now it's here. I must recommend this album to anyone who wants emotion and depth in their music. Rob Dickinson's voice is so expressive and even a little spooky sometimes. The first track, ""Sparks are Gonna Fly"", is an alt-rock assault and then you're plunged into the odd ""Gasoline."" From there it's quiet and loud at the same time and a little hard to describe. My favorite has got to be ""All of That"". For me, it's a personal anthem of self acceptance and it's strangley beautiful. If you are into Radiohead, The Verve, Slowdive or any similar bands, you should check this out. It's going to be one of the best this year.",1

"What You Don't Know CAN Hurt You

When I saw the latest hatchet job by Gene Lyons - who is a Clinton fan who has written a weekly column for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for years - I knew it would be worth a good laugh. Lyons is a fiction writer and this is unquestionably his most fictitious work. Let's consider what Mr. Lyons wants us to believe:1. That the GOP knew back in the 1980s that Clinton would get elected President not once but twice. This of course was why they tried to make sure he'd win the nomination. Yeah, makes sense to me.2. That lying under oath is okay if you're a Democratic President. I guess it isn't REALLY lying if you don't know what the definition of ""is"" is.3. That Clinton is virgin clean. If he thinks so, he needs to go ask Billy Dale, Linda Tripp, Richard Mellon Scaife, and Kenneth Starr about ""hunting.""This book - in terms of accuracy - can be used to two things. Either as a prominent fiction work.....or as a nice doorstop.",0

"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road - hello Shlocksville!

""El Dorado"" fails on all levels. Truly, this is a CD to avoid. Elton's fans should avoid it for the lackluster rhythms, simple chromatic melodies (if you can call them that)and banal Tim Rice lyrics and forced rhymes. Disney film fans - this is NOT Lion King of the Central American Jungle! There is no grand opening melodic sweep like ""Circle of Light"" - instead you've got the moronic repetition of ""El Dorado."" There are no ballads like ""Can you hear the love"" - so there's nothing to compare it to. And the comic songs isn't very clever, although ""It's Tough to be a God"" comes close.

Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira was 89 years old with a resume that would let him make any damn film he wanted. So what did he do? He went autobiographical.

Introspective and subdued in both style and scenery.It can be difficult to read subtitles in a dialogue-heavy film. But once we reach Portugal, most lines are between a French speaker and a Portuguese speaker, with a translator, and the luxury (for me) of seeing the same thing in English subtitles twice. Even so, with an awareness that these films are a bit expensive in the US, I can't really recommend it.So what is it about? Beginnings and endings. What we remember, what we forget. Family relationships gone bad. Atonement. Unflinching realism. In that, it is brilliant. But hell, it might bore somebody, I don't know. So I respect it but I don't recommend it. Does that make any sense?",0
"crystal clear, yet absolutely poetic

I have many informative books that on naked eye astronomy. This is my favorite hands down. Chet Raymo has to be one of the most eloquent scientific writers in the universe. If you're looking for bare bones star charts that you can quickly reference, or tables of brightnesses, etc, this is NOT the book you're looking for. If however, you're interested in appreciating the beauty of the nightime sky, with explanations of the history behind the science, and crystal clear explanations of the ""geometry"" of our galaxy... what we can see in the nightime sky and why it changes the way it does, then this is the one. The language Chet uses is pure poetry. Not so much a book to be taken outside for use as a star reference as one which turns the night sky into a beautiful story. You read this one in sections. In a comfortable chair. Inside where it's warm. Then you put on your coat. Go outside. And look.... up.",1

"I'm not a kung fu expert but I play one on TV.

David Carradine is not considered a martial arts expert by anyone I know and I've been in the community for over 10 years. I find it funny that he criticized Bruce Lee for being more of an actor than a MA (this is what we call hypocrisy). Bruce Lee was a world class MA who brought Eastern and Western styles together. Carradine who is an actor who had to learn some Martial Arts for a role. If your interested in the TV show or Carradine then this is for you. If you want to know about Shaolin philosophy, then pick up a good book about Ch'an Buddhism - because that's what Shaolin monks practice. There are also much better books about MA philosophy like ""Zen in the Martial arts"" and ""Beyond the Known"".",0

"Poor, Inaccurate Solaris 9 Study Guide

I'm a Solaris instructor and our firm reviewed this book because it was the first one out and we needed a Solaris 9 training guide for our students; I returned it. In short, here's our review: Gibbs has 3 sentences on managing disks with SMC, nothing on managing core dumps, nothing on Flash archives, nothing on fssnap, nothing on printers, one sentence on smpatch. Gibbs devotes an entire chapter to vi and another entire chapter on basic command syntax- both are not on the exam. Gibbs also includes sections on Admintool and Adminsuite when both products have been discontinued in Solaris 9. Gibbs still refers to SVM as DiskSuite and the book contains numerous typos (ie. syslogc). Gibbs tells the reader to use rlogin, rcp, rsh and does not even speak of the secure shell. I could go on and on about what this book has missed. In short, we started using the Calkins Solaris 9 Training Guide (pub. Que) and our students are getting certified and getting jobs.",0

"Very poor toaster

I've used this toaster daily for a couple of weeks now, and the only thing it has going for it is looks and price. I read Amazon reviews for everything else, don't know why I didn't in this case.The first problem is that it doesn't toast evenly. Some of the ""coils"" don't seem to get hot (red), so there are bands in your toast that aren't browned. It has to be turned up very high to get the whole piece, then the rest is so hard it's unpleasant. Plus, that makes the cooking time much longer. Secondly, when the toast is finally done, the bread doesn't come out far enough so that for even a regular sized slice of bread your fingers have to touch the hot toaster to get the piece out.I absolutely do not recommend this toaster.",0

Based on the photo, I expected a colorful book, full of pictures of hot sauce bottles, chilis, and what-not. There are no pictures, just listings. It has all the excitement of the local phone directory. The paper is newsprint-like, adding to the ""yellow pages"" tone of the book. It is very small in reality, pocketbook size, and thin.

"Their ""Christian Theology"" is 'ashamed of Christ'

...and what kind of 'Christian' theology is that? BCE? CE? Gosh, don't let's go and stir up controversy by engaging in the global convention of BC/AD, you know, that 'Christ' and 'year of Our Lord' stuff, especially not in a mandatory introduction to _Christian_ theology written by, one hopes, ostensible Christians for students who are not exactly being forced to attend an ostensibly Christian college.If you teachers of Christian theology are ashamed of the whole Christ thing, then switch to sociology. For Christ's sake, eh? Do Jews shy away from saying that Jesus was not the Messiah, or Muslims from claiming that Jesus was (but) a prophet and not the Son of God?Why then must professional Christians, paid to teach Christianity, at a Christian school, shrink away from the most fundamental claim of Christianity, i.e. that Jesus is the Christ who so changed the world that time is divided into an 'after' and a 'Before' Christ?",0
"Gregg Araki is a big........Squirtle Burger??

Well at some point during this film my soul died. I cant really imagine why anyone would want to pay money to destroy their soul. To people who enjoy good indie films I can only try to warn you what a mistake paying money for this film would be.Whats so bad about this film is that it thinks its clever, with its ridculous slang (yes squirtle burger is but one of the many brilliant insults used in the film), its stupid cliche and obvious metonyms, and its cast of actors who, although i know are somewhat talented, are utterly useless in this instance. They all seem to have aquired the keanu reeves 'plank of wood' style of acting. In short There are much better indie films out there which portray similar messages much better and that arent a big waste of money. I mean the money spent on this film could have been used to save children that are dying in africa....but apparently this piece of film torture was more important.",0

I would recommend staying away from optimum nutrition. If you don't believe me, just try Body Fortress yourself. You can get a 2 pound container for only $15 at Walmart or several other stores/sites.

I eventually found myself skimming through a lot of the religious/folk stuff regarding the statue and the group of honey worshippers. When the author talked about the calender girls waxing the statue with honey all I could think was... gross? sticky? It just seemed like they were taking the bee thing waaaaay too far.I wasn't satisfied how things ended up in a nice, neat little bow too. Lily's dad spent years making her life miserable and was livid at her dissapearance, but in the span of one conversation that was all reversed and ""OK, Lily, you can live with the nice strange ladies that I've never met, as long as it makes you happy."" It was all just too far-fetched and self-serving.",0

So if you only have mp3s in your computer, you'll be lucky enough to fit eight or nine of them on here, which is certainly not two hours of music.I think it's a waste -- who the hecks wants to carry around ten songs around all day for seventy bucks, that's what cd players are for! -- and I'm going to sell this thing on ebay for as much as I can get and buy the ipod.",0

There just isn't enough room to get this tool around the heater core pipe. I gave up after 15 min. of trying. I finally found the trick using no tool...Dont just pinch the tabs on the hose fitting and pull. You need to pinch the tabs, then push the fitting forward towards the fireware (this removes the tension on the tabs against the pipe), then pull forward. It comes right off. The trick is getting the tension off the tabs first by pushing forward with the tabs depressed. Once to do it, you'll go ""wow that was easy"". The rear heater hose comes off the same way.",0
"Caruso Pro Traveler 14 Molecular Hairsetter - BUYER BEWARE!

Hoffman is at the top of his game, Alec Baldwin is his typical understated comic genius (the delivery of the ""So...THAT happened"" line is a clinic on comic timing and delivery, and should be taught in acting classes), Bill Macy is superb-no other word adequately can be used to describe his performance. Sarah Jessica Parker and Julia Stiles are great in their supporting roles. If you love movies, know a little about what you THINK goes on behind the scenes, WATCH THIS MOVIE!

I thought I had found the perfect thing - a way to get books and magazines in Russia where I live and work.On my annual trip to the USA I bought a Kindle, downloaded a couple of books, went to the airport and settled in to do some more reading shopping before flight - and it won't turn on! It lasted all of two days.My flight was canceled, so now I at least have a chance to return this junk since I had an unexpected additional overnight here.Originally I had bought a Sony Reader in London Duty Fee, a great quality unit. I got home to Moscow and discovered there's no reading material available for it. 100 classics - thanks, I did that in College.Bought the Kindle - great reading selection but the unit is poor quality.Looks like an opening here for Panasonic. You guys should stick to retailing and let the experts invent and build electronics.Back to reading the old fashioned way - buying books in airports and hauling books all over the place.",0
"Filled with a lot of useless information

I used this book for a networks class in college. It does cover all the material that we went over in class. Although this book does contain a lot of useful information, it is also stuffed full of some complete nonsense. There's a lot of stupid stupid examples when they try to describe something technical with real world situtations. Sometimes the examples don't even relate well but are just in there because the authors felt they had to force an example into the book. Because we had to read the book for class I spent a bunch of hours reading through 500 pages of text with only 200 pages of real information. The main problem with this book is that it's really a 200 page book expanded out to 700-800 pages and I really can't appreciate that cause I have to read so much more.",0

"Trash fest

If the religious right needs more fuel for their anti-gay crusades, I'm sure they would be happy to add this film to their ammunition. Promiscuous sex, drug use and the whole concept of an older gay couple using a young boy as their ""toy"" is bad enough. Nick May is very good in the title role and manages to create a sympathetic portrayal of a young guy desperately in need of love. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the script basically only uses one sexual encounter after another to paint his plight. The last five minutes promises a glimpse of what this film could have been. Too bad the viewer has to sit through total dreck to get there.",0

First of all, let me reccomend that you watch (OR BUY!) all of J and SR's other flicks such as: Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma because of all the inside jokes.From the very start of the movie you know you're in for a wild ride of gross-out crude humor that will keep you laughing 'till the end.

I don't understand all the great reviews either. The story was boring, the characters were awful, the plot was not written well.Jessica is so aggressive, and Dain was so immature.

But I don't remember growing up and being so...childish.Why did she shoot him? I was so blown away at the scene with confusion.Also, I couldn't get over Dain's attitude toward his son near the end. How could you ignore a child who you know will feel as ugly as you did? Why would you ignore their existence, let them live in the same loneliness you did?And these two just couldn't make a more unlikely pair. They didn't belong together.Definitely not one of Chase's best.",0
"For what type of children, exactly?

Criticisms are so many, that it is difficult to express them clearly.Plot: The substory of the captain (the bad guy) distracts from the mainline (which is a good premise, though totally botched). There is no development between characters (especially between the mermaid and the retarded professor). It is never clear what is going on.Dialogues: They are sketchy, and they don't sound like normal exchanges between people.Humor: just pie in the face all the time, not one intelligent joke. The Three Stoges did this kind of humor already, and better. This is unfunny.Acting: Billy Zane and his daughter are quite good, although characters are overboard.Visuals: The only good part. Mermaid is gorgeous, daughter is cute, sceneries are great.I stopped watching after 45 minutes.",0
"no, no, no

There's a lot of hype surrounding the Resident Evil series of games. They're on most systems, there are books, and even a movie. The story is a good one, but I found the game to not be so great. Graphics are alright, the sound is bad though. And game play is horrible. Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing, especially when you're under attack and things are chaotic. The characters move unlike most games. You don't go in the direction of the D-pad, rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button. It was poorly designed. But since the Playstation 2 is out, and better games as well as more Resident Evil, there's no reason to pick up this game anymore. The 2-disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female. The game is involved, just not as much fun as it shoud be",0

"This game is a demo

I say that this game is a demo because it is clearly was released six months before completion. The bugs and glitches are multitude. We have become used to seeing games released before they are totaly de-bugged but this (believe me) is the record. Buggs aside, the main problem is that the game has not even been completed--it is a rough sketch of a possibly great art work. Perhaps 50% of the scenarios fuction reasonably correctly (excluding the bugs). If you have Voodoo 3 don't buy this untill its Voodoo problems are sorted out (check the message boards at the Talonsoft website). In fact, if you have been eagerly awaiting this game , check out the message boards over the next few weeks (or possibly months) and wait untill a completed, functional version of this product is available. I suspect the problems may be too large to fix with four or five downloads.",0

"I want my $17 back

After hearing a few of the awesomely catchy songs by the Dandy Warhols (""Boys Better,"" ""Cool Scene,"" ""Not if You Were the Last Junkie and Earth,"" and ""Bohemian Like You"") I was hooked on the addictive sound of the group. So I took a chance and decided to buy the new album instead of 13 Tales From Urban Bohemia. BAD choice. ""Welcome to the Monkeyhouse"" sounds like the Warhols were forced back to the 80's and aren't very happy about it. The sound here isn't trippy, it's just narcotizing. It pretty much put me to sleep behind the wheel. The CD captured all of the annoying synth sounds of the era and none of the power. As one reviewer noted, if I had wanted to listen to some new wave, I would have bought the real thing, not a tired tribute.Some reviewers seem to think this CD has merit becuase it's ""experimental""-- well, that's fine, but I wish the experiment came with a cash back guarantee.",0
"Durable, but too much downtime

This Dewalt is a durably built sander, but the plastic ring used for the controlled finishing feature wears out much too quickly. I only get about 4-6 hours of use before this part need replacing. No home improvement, hardware, or building supply sells this part in my area, which means it has to be ordered everytime the part wears out, meaning too much downtime. Not only does this part have to be replaces every 4-6 hours of use, the part itself costs $7 to $8 apiece. This is extremely poor design and needs to be corrected. The hook and loop also stopped accepting sand paper after about 10 hours of use, however, I'm using the cheaper priced adhesive backed paper on the worn pad and it works fine. As much as I use the sander, I would be much better off buying another brand sander with the money it takes to replace the controlled finishing ring and the pad. I'm going with a porter cable or BOSCH.",0

How tired I am of reading people saying how HOT Jennifer Love Hewitt looks in this movie. Yes, it is very true, but this is really not enough to be called a MOVIE, but perhaps a skin-flick in disguise. Hewitt parades her body and performs actions that should have given this movie an ""R"" rating, and not PG-13. Though they may not SHOW all of the sexual acts, they are certainly not subtle, and think about it, should a 13-year-old really be watching and emulating such acts? I certainly hope not.I gave this movie 2 stars because I had a few laughs and did enjoy the ending.

I have been hearing great thing about this book from a lot of different people who used it to study from and pass the Server+ exam. I have to agree, this book is book is well organized and easy to read. I was mostly impressed with the layout of the book. I liked how the author has the exam objectives laid out throughout the book so you know what you are studying. The review questions are simulated identically to actual exam test questions. The book comes with a CD-ROM full of practice test questions and free Server/network monitoring tools. I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in achieving his or her Server+ certification or to anyone interested in Network server operations.",1

"Good value

First of all, I'd like to say how pleasurable it is to shop online here at Amazon.com. The whole buying and shipping process is always a breeze and I hardly shop anywhere else online now.I purchased and moved to a new-to-me house in November and decided to get all new smoke alarms as the old ones looked really old and were only single sensor. Double sensor alarms are now required here in Oregon, so that narrowed the field considerably. Decided on this one due to reputation, reviews, features, ease of use, and price. So far, the two I purchased seem to be working very well with only one minor glitch.I mounted one inside the master bedroom above the door and twice now it has false alarmed as I walked into the room. Mildly annoying but not a big deal. Doesn't do it for my wife, though. I guess it doesn't like me ... LOL.I am very happy with this product. Recommended. Don't forget to change the batteries.",1
"step up.

Last year I bought a Bella juicer from Macys and I liked it except for the clean up and mess. This one is just a tad easier to clean because of where the pulp goes, therefore debris doesn't fly up out of the pulp container. I feel like the clean up is less complicated but otherwise it is still lengthy. This one came with a brush for cleaning the mesh/bladed area. Nice. It also feels like a more smooth suction on pulling the veggies in to be juiced. It's sleek looking and large. I still have to cut my apples to put in the juicer, I am assuming the apples they are talking about that fit are those tiny Fiji apples. Not my green ones. Overall I do like this juicer but I still have to juice for two or three days if I can so I don't have to wake up 30 minutes earlier everday to juice and clean the device.",1
"Summitt Refrigerators

My wife and I bought a Summit Refrigerator FF975SS. Big mistake! Anybody considering a Summit refrigerator... reconsider!

Very rude and totally uncooperative! In a service business, they have no service, or even worse... bad and rude and belligerent service. I cannot express how unhappy we are with this company. Stay clear. Word to the wise...!",0
"Mellow, ethereal, and a little creepy

Another reviewer mentioned how #9 ""Tree"" sounds like it came from The Shining. This track begins very similarly to how Penderecki's 1974 ""The Dream of Jacob"" begins. The Penderecki track and a few of his others (De Natura Sonoris #1 & #2) are indeed used in The Shining. Those 3 tracks are available on a Penderecki disc by the Polish Radio Symphony.That said, this is a great disc. Most of the tracks are quite good with a lot of variety. Good stuff to study to. Tree and Curtains are creepy. Rhubarb is a far mellower cousin to Girl Boy Song. Weathered Stone is odd. Tassels is horrible - it sounds like a plane taking 7 minutes to crash land.Lichen recalls Bungie's video game score to Marathon. Match Sticks sounds like something by Angelo Badalamenti - guy who does music for David Lynch movies: Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, etc.Do yourself a favor and upgrade your headphones while you're grabbing this album.

This book is incredible. It's heartfelt and practical and I can't put it down. I have it in my nightstand droor because I am always going through it and re-reading sections for a refresher in my parenting skills. I love how it talks about how you can't just assume that if your kids are going to church that they are automatically going to love God and serve Him with all of their hearts and not walk in the ways of the world. You have to cultivate a love for God in the way we live our lives at home as parents. We've got to be the real deal!

Well I am a huge Hellraiser fan and was actually excited about another Hellraiser being made. Even though I knew Doug Bradley wouldn't be playing Pinhead, I was still anxious to see this movie.

Let me tell you, all of the bad reviews are dead on! This movie was horrible. Everything about it was bad. The acting was just awful, the story was weak and Pinhead sucked. Bottom line is if you are a Hellraiser fan, do yourself a favor and don't expose yourself to this trash.",0

While The Rules of Attraction is definitely not for everyone, I loved it and I'm sure that plenty of other people will love it too.

"Junk!

I ordered this and it was delivered on time and as stated. The original compressor lasted 3 months before failing on the AC input. It was replaced by B&D at no charge. The replacement compressor lasted 6 months and again the AC input failed. After talking with customer service at B&D, they requested the second one be returned and upon it's receipt a third replacement would be shipped at no charge. I was told by customer service the AC input circuit had been changed and would not fail as the first two had! The third compressor lasted 9 months before the AC input again failed. I have the original and the failed 3rd compressor that both work on DC power. The AC input failures all made a loud ""POP"" noise and never worked after this happened. None of these compressors were used for anything other than car tires, bikes and a wheel barrow. My original B&D Air Station lasted for over 10 years before it failed.

It's hard not to like ""Odd Thomas"", by that I mean the character himself. He's a sensitive, self-depreciating twenty-year-old who just happens to be able to see and communicate with the dead. Odd's unusual ""gift"" has left him with a rather heavy burden to bear; the ability to commune with victims of crime (and hopefully find their killers), as well as a knowledge of future tragedies. This foreshadowing of danger is made clear to Odd by his ability to see ""bodachs"", malevalent, spirit-like creatures who thrive on impending doom. Odd's quest to discover and avert an unknown disaster is well written and interesting, but I did feel the ending was somewhat rushed and underdeveloped. Odd is such a unique and likeable character however, that perhaps we could look forward to his appearance in a sequel.",1

"Mediocre performance for an emergency light!

I own several crank style flashlights and even crank flashlight/radio combos for emergency use and for travel. This one is probably the one I like the least. It is hard to charge and it does not hold the charge very long. The crank is very easy to turn but you have to crank it very fast, 2 to 3 turns per second, to even build up a reasonable charge. Other units I have are much harder to turn and as the batteries in the flashlights charge they progressively get harder to turn.This flashlight at its best could hold a 10 minute charge but even after limited use it quickly declined to about 3 to 5 minutes. Other units I own can operate the flashlight for up to 1 hour and the charging took the same time at slower cranking speeds. For dependability and the duration of the light, this one is not a good selection. You should look for better alternatives.",0

this is what great suspense/horror movies are all about. when it first came out i was a little skeptical about it. i mean come on a trucker trying to kill some kids because of a joke? but i saw it for the first time, and i was like S*@t. they made this totally believable. not only that, but totally creepy. Ted Levine's voice as ""Rusty Nail"" is perfect. if you don't know who that is, he's Buffalo bill in silence of the lambs. but his voice has matured a bit, in a creepy way. This is a great movie, i watched it twice in a row to see if i could believe it twice in a row and i'll be damned if it wasn't better the second time around. Great acting from all 3 actors, though at times i felt like paul walker was a little too valley for my taste. steve zahn continues to crack me up even in a movie like this.

On this self-titled album, Robert and The Cure sound so uninspired througout this entire release. They marketed this as a much angrier side to The Cure. Well if ""angrier"" were synonymous with ""old, overweight rich men trying desperately to seem relevent in a sad attempt to take money from angst-ridden, wannabe hipster teens who think bands like Interpol and The Walkmen are good, thought-provoking music"" then yes they have succeeded.

Kipling said that Afghanistan is a country easier to get into than out of. As the Russians learned, and as perhaps we Americans are learning now.

As such, it presents a view that most of us outsiders can't quite imagine.

The conversations are quite natural and not artifically spiked with interesting tidbits that real life doesn't often have. Real life can be monotonous and petty, yes you still get hungry even if you have had a death(s) in the family.

Mostly, I was awed by the fact that she was illiterate for all of her youth, and described herself freely as still not able to read and write properly.

This movie was just ok. On one hand, the production values are quite high especially relative to what I expected. The cast also isn't half bad, and it's a bit fun to see the little girl from one of the latter Halloween movies (part 5?) all grown up. So with the production and the cast, it's good enough to watch and you won't necessarily regret having done so.On the other hand, the story isn't that good. From nearly the first five minutes, the entire movie is completely predictable so don't expect any surprises. It's also not particularly effective; the pacing is slow and the conflict moments lack impact.If you're looking at this for Tiffany Shepis, know she has a very limited role as a mother figure, not the role she typically plays and which has earned her some measure of fame.Recommended as a rental.",0

so this product is a bit more pricey than manic panic hair dye. It's my first time using special effects and i'll i have to say is that its definitely better than manic panic! The color came out really bright but i was a bit dissapointed that it didn't last longer. like the other user said, when it fades it turns into a lavenderish color. I will definitely be buying more products from special effects!",1
"Built to fail

Same as other people that rated this product one star. Works fine for about a year, then the battery dies. The reason is because B&D; used the cheapest batteries and chargers it could get.Note to people who still have a working unit: don't leave your vacuum always plugged in. The constant trickle of electricity slowly kills the batteries. Better to put it on a timer and charge it for short time each day. Also, try to completely drain the batteries every month or two. If you do this, the batteries will last much longer. I found this out after my unit died.I WILL NEVER BUY A BLACK & DECKER PRODUCT AGAIN",0

!Heather's Teenage Son!Ah yes...this album was one of the most hilarious Blink-182 albums I've ever listened to. With songs like ""Just About Done"" and ""Ben Wah Balls."" The songs on this are raw, but I'm used to it. M+M's is a great and funny love song that I can play over and over again...it's one of my favorite ones on the album. My other favaorite songs are Fentoozler and Touchdown Boy. So, if you're looking for some oldschool Blink, this is the album for you!",1

"A book that will haunt you with its beauty

I devoured this book last weekend. From the first page, the plot and its main character/s held me, and I was almost unable to put it down. It is set in Pennsylvania, in an Amish community, and there is a quiet peace in the daily chores and rituals of the characters, combined with the building tension and mystery of the death/murder at the core of the story. One of the most interesting things about the book, is it's references to the para-normal, along with a romance (which touched me). It is a haunting, suspenseful novel, and I HIGHLY recommend it.",1

(...)You would think that if the Romans were going to create a new unifying state religion, they would also create overwhelming historical, and governmental documentation testifying to the existence of their new god incarnate. This apparently is the same documentation that the author can't find. Seems like a pretty shabby conspiracy to me. If you can create a book that convinces billions of people to believe a religion, that according to the author isn't based on any fact, I would think that you could forge some historical documents?",0
"When writing reviews, please remember Mr. Doohan

Although I find Eartha Kitt to be a much more formidable villain-type actor than Ricardo Montalban, all the same I did find The Wrath of Khan to be a delight for the eyes. I think that this film is great for parents who want to traumatize their kids with images of worms and ears and charred bodies and Shatner's acting. I also want to tell all reviewers to remember the importance of Mr. Doohan as Scottie. His acting when talking about Mr. Preston really... touched my heart in ways I can't even begin to describe.

"CD & DVD recording - 2ed

For someone who is a real novice I suspect that there is a lack of basic information to get that person started. For someone who is a step above a novice the book (latest edition) is already badly out of date and still doesn't cover popular software written years before the publication data (e.g., Pinnacle Clean). It does not cover any of the problems one encounters with music recording. It simply tells you how to transfer files from your computer to a CD or DVD and because that is simply a matter of clicking on buttons for software included on most computers it doesn't help.",0

This is a great cd, not providing the fact that Puffy basically did the whole album, so actually it was Puffy's album. Mase is Puffy's scapegoat, well, kinda. Mase himself is aiight, but the reason he didn't do so good on ""Double Up"" is because Puff didn't help so much on that album. I bought this album from BMG musicservice ... [at] not a bad price, but it was kind of disappointing. I got Double Up at a pawn shop..., and it is okay, but not as good as Harlem World right here. If you really wanna get Mase, get this one, but I wouldn't really reccomend him...if u want REAL rap, holla at Master P, Tru, Dre, NWA, C-Murder, Mystikal, B.I.G., or South Park Mexicans.

"OK, But not worth your studying time

While I found the story in this book quite interesting, I do not think that it significantly improved my vocabulary. By using an ""SAT Word"" once in the book, I did not learn that word. The same words should have been repeated more than once, when possible. Perhaps, as another review suggested, the definitions should appear at the bottom of the page and not in the back - constantly flipping to the glossary was detrimental to my reading experience. I would not reccomend buying this book to learn vocabulary words, although I think the approach has some merit.",0
"The fire died out-I couldn't finish this book.

Lisanne Norman's series had a high and a low point for me. Somehow I treaded past the first book Turning point and went on to the more interesting book after that, Fortune's Wheel. But, about 3/4ths of the way through Razor's Edge, I put the book down and never picked it back up. I was kind of sick of Leskas and when 3 person Leskas began appearing that was it for me. I guess I'm just a two-person traditonalist. Plus, the abilities of the telepaths are kind of hazy-you don't really know what they can do, exactly. I know that even they don't know all they can do, but still...Was it me or did Norman's writing get a bit mechanical? Carrie seemed to lose most of her personality. Overall, the series died out, going from interesting to tiring. Maybe her next book will lift it out of the dredge.",0

"Snail's pace melodrama

I expected much more from Tarintino. I expected the energetic, zany, ultraviolent rollercoster I saw in all his previous projects- ""Resevoir Dogs,"" ""True Romance,"" ""From Dusk till Dawn,"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" But his latest film, ""Jackie Brown"" left me wanting more. I think Tarintino purposley tried to screw his die-hard fans with this movie. It's the opposite of his other films. It's a logically told, slow moving, even DULL mix of mystery, satire, action, and campy comedy. It's complexity actually hurts it. The running time is much to long and it never really gets intresting. The cast is really good, but other than that you get nothing you've come to expect out of a Quinton Tarintino film.",0

"If you don't have a sense of humour, don't bother!

Now I know why I usually pay no heed to jaded music critics. How anyone can see this album as nothing more than a ""Weird Al"" ripoff is beyond me.This is by far one of my favourite albums in my collection - a collection with its fair share of classic albums. In a time where so many people consider ""pop"" to be a dirty word (thanks to the neverending stream of boy bands and pop ""divas""), this album saves the day with its catchy riffs, unaffected humour and freespirited pure pop goodness.An album that will appeal to any age, but with references that will certainly resonate more soundly with listeners who experienced the 70s and/or the 80s in all their glory. For those of us who danced to Haysi Fantayzee ('Vivian'), got ""Pac-Man fever"", adored the A-Team and CHiPS ('For You') and lived through the big-haired heavy metal heyday of the 80s (`Pantera Fans in Love'), this album is the perfect trip down memory lane.",1
"A book you don't forget.

I would have rated this book four stars because it was edited and published posthumously, and therefore has a few rough spots one has to push through. Otherwise, it is a magnificent book covering all aspects of the Mann Gulch fire. Others have reviewed the story elsewhere in excellent manner.However, this book earned back its fifth star. It is rare and amazing when the author, at one level writes a book of non-fiction that itself is so factual and compassionate. But the fifth star is earned for while he is doing this ""work of nonfiction"" at such a high level, you realize towards the end that while he is writing about this fire and the death of those 13 men, what he is really talking about is loving testament to his wife and of how she died. One rarely sees this ability displayed at such a high level. (As an aside, you will never view ""A River Runs Through It"" the same way after reading this book.)",1
"Good, but not perfect.

"If you like the grindhouse type of movies you might want to give this a look !!

This movie is as crazy as its title . If you can put up with seeing nuns getting beaten , doing drugs , getting raped and then killing the bad guys . well my friends this is the movie for you . The story is sort of weak and the acting is what you might expect , but lots of T & A and killing make up for the weaker points I mentioned . The movie leaves off with the suggestion that there is going to be a part 2 . So for me and I am grading it on the type of movie it is certainly not expecting an oscar quality film . I liked it overall , it shocked me at times, being a catholic I was left shaking my head . But again its a different kind of movie , you expect killing and blood , you expect T & A and you get pleanty of both along with the shock quality just based on the theme alone . Go For it if you like these types of films , Im looking forward to Part 2 .",1

So many recipes call for items that I have never heard of or have to go out and buy for a one time only use. What a waste of money! With this cookbook you can decide at the last minute in the morning to gab a recipe, use the items on hand, throw together, put in the crock pot and out the door you go to then come home to a great meal. Plus most of the recipes have several variations of the same item in case you don't have one ingredient but you have another. I have tried a lot of the recipes and 90% of them my husband and I loved. Believe me..... I have gotten my money's worth from this book. I have recommended this cookbook to several friends and they love it too!",1

"Ugggg Taxidermy!

I was disgusted to find, in the October issue, a 4 page article on Martha's collection of stuffed animals. Can't understand why, or how, she could talk about all the wildlife she attracts to her yard on one hand, and have the nerve to show a bear, mountain lion, birds and several other animals obviously murdered for the sake of this sick hobby! She even offers a reprinted book called Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit! Unbelievable! I have canceled my subscription and will not buy another of her products.",0
"Sub-par album from one of rock's greats

Mind Games is far from Lennon's best. Plastic Ono Band and Imagine tower above Mind Games like the Empire State Building. By 1973, Lennon, like much of his generation, was burning out, and Beatles fans know he was not in the best frame of mind at this point. The title track is good but it sounds like the little brother of ""Imagine,"" one of Lennon's best songs. Another song, ""You are here"" is an undiscovered gem, but the album as a whole is poorly-produced and the rockers sound tired. Buy this CD if you can find it used for a few bucks.",0

"Lame

I am so disappointed! After reading the great reviews I ordered this DVD set without hesitation. Ten minutes in I started worrying, by 30 minutes in I was apolgizing to my husband and by 45 we gave up. I had to come back and see if I had correctly read the reviews. It is slowly paced, ridiculously acted and I'm sorry but terribly implausible. I completely enjoy historical and in particular western themed movies but this was not watchable. I say this as someone who doesn't purchase a lot of media and considered this a splurge.",0
"Claptrap

This book is complete and utter heresy! I'm giving it one star only because Amazon's ratings don't allow negative integers. Not only does this chump have no idea what he's talking about, but he seems to be a coward also. Not worth the paper it took to print it. Pass on this one folks.",0
"Just a war story

Turtledove has written some good stuff (Guns of the South, How Few Remain), but this is just a war story about a war that never was, for the most part.What makes alternate history special for me is the chance to understand real history better, and what might have been had things turned out differently. Despite the title and hype, there isn't much of that here. Instead, Turtledove follows a bunch of fairly ordinary folks through long and not particularly compelling narratives.Very disappointing, but then The Two Georges, another letdown, should have warned me. Turtledove has skill at characterization and can write a crackerjack book when he wants to, but it seems that now he is just riding the crest of popularity and churning them out.Be warned, folks, and give this one a pass. You want good alternate history?:Ward Moore, Bring the JubileeH. Beam Piper, Lord Kalvan of OtherwhenRobert Harris, Fatherland",0
"Im surprised by the other good reviews

I have read many of the Alex Delaware novels. I initially liked them but got bored. This one seems completely contrived, like Jonathan Kellerman has totally run out of ideas and should forget Alex Delaware. Alex' new relationship has no substance, and his old one lost its substance. Milo's gayness has lost its edge and teh story seemed pretty flat to me. I was interested in the Erna and Kevin characters but they both just died like an afterthought, so much for them. Anyway, boring book i would say.",0

"Beautiful Coffee Table book

If your family has any Dutch heritage your family castle will probably be in this book. Each castle is described in some detail, many have a single BW picture but the more significant have large colour spreads. The external ( there are no internal pictures ) Dutch style of larger farm house and castle is well presented in this book and the general presentation quality is excellent. While in Holland I visited a number of castles and I have found this book to be a superb reminder of the places and sights.",1
"The most reader-friendly book on the subject to date!

In Babies For Beginners, author David Brizer starts at the literal beginning of conception and then takes the reader on an hilarious but accurate, step-by-step process in how baby develops within the mother, her labor, childbirth, and development through infancy. Brizer covers child-rearing basics, genetic, environmental , social and psychological influences, toddlerhood, and more. The fun and informative texts is profusely illustrated on every page by the cartoon artistry of Ricardo Castaneda. Babies For Beginners is the most reader-friendly ""birds and bees"" book on where babies come from (and what to do with them once they get here) ever written.",1
"Misleading Propaganda

This book is naught but a string of straw men to produce propaganda. Rightists will love it for their ""view"" being parroted out mindlessly and it's ""debunking"" of the feminist position when it just cherry picks quotes from non-mainstream members of the feminist movement and falsely claims it's the majority opinion and then proceeds to rip up the straw man it produced.This book is not a book about women, it is a book about misogyny. Feminism is merely the belief that both sexes are equal, it's a poor name for such a belief but that is what it is called.Sure there are androgynous individuals who claim they speak under the banner of feminism - but they are anathema to feminism as well, because feminism is about the equality of both sexes, not the supremacy of women.This is yet another dirty bomb in the culture war - the war on modernity being waged by regressives.",0
"Interesting Information on the Final Days of Hitler

This book uncovers a wealth of Soviet information concerning the last hours of Adolf Hitler and what happened to his body. Not only is good, convincing data provided but rare photos of Hitler's body but also even one of Blondi (Hitler's dog whom was a guinea pig in a cynide effectiveness experiment). The book's only drawback was the author's over-the-top Soviet disposition and inclinations. However, this book is well worth the time of those who are history buffs or those who just want to know exactly what happened in Hitler's bunker.",1

"Trading on His Name

Stephen King is in the position where if he bundled up his old junior high notebooks and sent them to his agent, publishers would bid on them.The is the only explanation for THE COLORADO KID.The plot is, ""What if there was a murder with mysterious clues that made no sense at all? The end."" Gee, a mystery story with no solution! That probably isn't tried more than a hundred times a year by unpublished authors, to be met with form letter rejection every time (wouldn't Form Letter Rejects be a great name for a band?).Written so quickly that King places a Starbucks in 1980 Denver, and since publishers have been too embarassed to edit Mr. King for well over a decade, it stayed in the book.",0
"Not Bad for Theroux Fiction

I am a great fan of Theroux's travel books, as his journey and perspective is always amusing, educational, smart, and insightful. His fiction, however, can be overly self-absorbed, constricted, and sometimes just plain dull.This one is slightly better than that -- he seems to have taken time to actually write a whole novel, as opposed to a good idea written poorly. Here, both the idea of the book is great, a stalled writer opened by taking a mind-altering drug, then blinded and redeemed by the visions unleashed, but the execution is also interesting and the pacing strong. Miles above his last Hawaii book, this one has interesting interludes with Clinton, copious sex, and lots of drug use and abuse. Right up my alley! Seriously, though, if you have given up on Theroux's fiction, you may want to reconsider and give it a try. There's plenty of the good Theroux lurking in this book, and it was a pleasure to read and enjoy.",1
"Beautiful Deep House for a Beautiful Tomorrow

Jay Denes is a genius. This CD exemplifies the mellow yet sexy, jazzy, lush, deep house vibe that defines the Naked Music sound. Not since 4AD in their prime has a record lable released such consistently excellent work. The sultry, varied vocalists keep things extra sensuous and interesting. Contrary to another review, the production on this CD is absolutely pristine, very clean sounding, and exquisitely minimal/elegant. Denes will probably attract much attention from some big names (e.g., Madonna who suppposedly is a Naked Music fan) with this release. Hopefully their recent Astralwerks distribution deal will give Denes & company the exposure they deserve. Until the next Rurals, Los Amigos Invisibles, or Nude Dimensions 4 CD comes out, this has got to be the best dance release so far this year.",1

I am familiar with the academic world through my family. This is not a glimpse into that world. This is a caricature of the academic life. Maybe in Europe or in literary circles, they race to every conference out there for a chance to visit more interesting locales or vacation. From my experience going to conferences, this is a simplistic view. It is great that it makes fun of people who sometimes take themselves too seriously though and some of the humor is funny.

It reminded me of the old Harry Browne books of the 1970's with predictions of catastrophic economic collapse, the salvation available to those with gold and silver coins, and the imperative of numbered Swiss bank accounts.Every decade since Browne, one small group of authors after another have funded their old age by publishing visions of a financial Armageddon.

"joel's got the goods

for anyone who has listened to Thrush Hermit [Joel's prior incarnation] and is familiar with their fabulous farewell album, Clayton Park, Down at the Khyber just hits the spot. Even though the Khyber is the second solo endeavour for Plaskett and there is an obvious progression from his prior works, there is still a comforting familiarity of Plaskett-styled sincerity. The lyrics are kinda funny and don't really make much sense sometimes, but are sung so sincerely and with such sweetness that you can't help but understand what he's saying. Describing the sound is always nearly pointless; you must listen to it to feel the goodness. But, if you're into the catchy poppish-rockified-hint [slight bit] of countrified twang, try this out.",1

I forced myself to read the first 100 pages, hoping for something that would make me want to read on. Sadly, it just wasn't there.",0
"Great Band...Bad DVD

Don't get me wrong, EF are a fantastic band. All of their LPs are worthy of your hard-earned cash. This, however, is not. Bad video. Bad sound. Small crowd. You can only hear one guitar. And as great as these guys are, they pretty much just stand around on stage when playing. Do yourself a favor and buy How To Make A Monster or The Buzz of 1000 Volts instead.",0
"Unforgettable Movie!

This is the film that you will not forget.This is a story of two roommates attempting to get through one final season. Michael plays the role of a pitcher who is the roommate of Robert DeNiro who plays the role of the catcher.DeNiro isdiagnosed with Hodgkins disease. Michael as his roommate andintimate friend helps DeNiro cope with Hodgkins as well asmake the season to the end. This is one of the more touchingfilms that I have watched.It would compare to ""Brian's Song""as far as being emotional.DeNiro,in this movie definitely showedsigns of great things to come for him.And,who could ever forgetthe haunting song that accompanied the movie.A definite must see.",1
"""It's Him, The Eye ~ Here At The End Of All Things""

With the '03 release of `The Return of the King', the third and final film in the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy one can only seat back and marvel at the remarkable feat accomplished by Peter Jackson and crew. When one wants to speak of something that is truly of epic proportions this is now and will be for quite sometime the benchmark by which all other attempts will be measured. There simply isn't enough good things one could say about Frodo and company, a landmark ending to an unforgettable saga that only gets better with repeated viewings.If your personal DVD library is absent copies of `The Fellowship of the Ring"", `The Two Towers' and `The Return of the King' you're missing the best of the best.",1
"My 5 stars and 2 replies to the critics

It's the best book on the subject. Period. However, for those angrily giving low rating to it, I have two suggestions.1. Go see new user-friendly online versions of it at bodyrecomposition.com2.

First and foremost: Natalie Portman is no actress. The Academy Awards lost all credibility when she was awarded an Oscar for Black Swan.

"""Istambul"" in a minor key

Having read Pamuk's ""Istambul"" without pleasure I hesitated to read ""Snow."" I should have trusted my first impression. He cannot write a novel: everything is a reminiscence of his past, whether non-fiction or fiction. His people in ""Snow"" are wooden characters. You learn little about either secularism or Islamic fundamentalism. What you learn is how Pamuk feels at every moment, and I for one simply don't care.",0
"Tops all!

I love this show from the moment it aired. My daughter turned my eye to it. And every Friday we were glued. Every Friday...DAMN I miss it and can't wait for the second season. I hope they come harder than the first bringing nothing but boldness, blood and sand. And much much Glory. If people didn't like the show well you should've turned!!! I watch the reruns. And Thank the good one above for SHOWS ON DEMAND. I love 300 so the blood effects didn't bother me matter of fact beside the acting of very very fine ass men. If I didn't see any ass in the show I expected to see the blood. This isn't for the weak or pansy. At all its only for those True Gladiators out there. Can you all say it with me?

August evening is bathed in wonderful cinematography and a well acted storyline.

I bought this keyboard because I was buying a new computer and I wanted a cordless keyboard with internet keys and multimedia keys like my other computer has.My other computer came with an internet keyboard and I will never buy a keyboard with out those extra keys because they save me so much time.There are a few little problems that I have with it and they are: The keys take a little bit to get used to. The page back key is on the left side instead of the right side like my other keyboard. There is not a shut down key to shut down the computer like my other keyboard. The mouse is a bit annoying with the little red light able to be seen from the side. The mouse has no on/off botton to turn it off when you are not using it.The reason I bought this one instead of another one like my other internet keyboard is because they no longer make that keyboard and this was the closest keyboard to my old one.",1

If you are buying this special edition of the soundtrack for the bonus DVD (as I did) all I can say is don't.The actual soundtrack CD is just what you expect. If you've seen movie you know exactly what you are getting. Some excellent music is compiled here, all of which appeared in the movie.The DVD, however, is a very big let down. A very poorly animated short cartoon clip. Actually it looks more like Flash animation than actual normally done animated material. There is no dialouge, not real story and even more poorly done action scenes. It's a tremendous let down.So if you want the soundtrack I would suggest the regular version.",0

the basis of this book is that the hero is not recognized by the heroine after only a 7 year absence. granted he had lost an eye in prisonbut the author seems to feel that an eye patch would cause someone tototally not recoginze the ""love of her life"" whom she has pined for as she believed he died in prison. while i know historical romance sometimes makes suspension of belief necessary, i could not buy into the rest of the plot nor the characters with so simple an explanation.i also could not believe that the heroine would forgive her father for lying to her for years that her son had been stillborn & for 'selling' her in marriage to the villan just for money..i felt as if connie mason ran out of original ideas and just threw together a ridiculous plot in which to place these poorly drawn characters.",0

This is a very nice box with a good selection of tea, and I was pleased with it.

I realize most people think these are staples of bagged teas, but when they are in practically every single tea chest you buy, you get tired of it and I personally don't care for either one.

"Dull

Despite a terrific performance by Sean Penn, and a decent one from Nicole Kidman, this movie didn't move me. It manages to be both dull and improbable. There's a lot of Screenwriting 101 in it, stakes raised in a way that, unfortunately, feels very artificial. It also seems quaintly nostalgiac in its depiction of the UN. The founders of the UN might have fantasized it would work like this in 2005, but it doesn't.It's diverting enough if you've seen everything else, or if you are a fan of the stars. But keep your expectations low.",0

(Of all the pictures I have, it was the only picture like that.) The people at Cingular stated that they couldn't do anything to save the picture. I found this setup that had both the cable for my old phone and the new phone and the software for what I considered to be peanuts. I purchased it and was able to save the picture of my baby girl both to my computer as well as to my new phone. I was willing to pay anything and $12 was nothing to pay to save that memory.",1

This cookbook, although it's almost a century old, is chock full of good recipes. Some, like the Cold Pigeon Pie, probably won't appeal to many people, but many others look worthy of a try out.

Alright. My wife picked this out at the video store, and I failed to look to see what it was.

From the get-go you can pick out who is going to win, who is going to die, and even who the crazy one is. Enter the ""slashers."" I have to say that the ""slashers"" are the only reason I kept watching. After the movie ended, I was sitting there astonished at how much I liked it.

"Typos and mistakes galore! So how solid is the history?

After visiting Scotland last summer, I was excited to find this book. The wild Scottish coast is an intriguing context for adventure, courage, and (here) amazing engineering achievement. However, the book is a huge disappointment. The story is potentially quite a compelling one, but the HUGE number of mistakes--both in the editing and proofreading and factually--detract to an overwhelming degree from one's possible enjoyment of the book. If this were a paper from one of my students, it would get about a C-. Given the number of mechanical errors in the book, one might be very skeptical about the historical facts, as well. And if it isn't good history, it sure doesn't cut it as decent fiction. If you want to read this one, check it out of the library. Don't waste your money on a flawed book.",0

"Viewing this movie may kill brain cells

I saw the first movie 4 times in the theatre, and this one once on video. Once you get past the recasting of actors, the addition of too many new characters for the length of this film, poor dialogue, bad acting, and the lack of plot, you have a couple of really good fight scenes (and a few attractive women in leotards). But that doesn't rescue this movie from a fiery, downward spiral. The sad part was, I didn't think any movie based on a martial arts video game could be worse than Street Fighter, but this one was (but not by a whole lot). Please do not waste your time with this movie - Utterly Horrible!!!",0

"Music for a new generation!!!

This new Canadian sensation has the sound that people are looking for! Whatever Canada is doing up there I hope they keep it up. She is quickly climbing the charts on Billboard, the Much Music countdown, and TRL on MTV. You may have heard her song ""Complicated"" on the radio. If you love that the rest of the album won't dissapoint you. She is somewhere between Alanis Morisette and new songwriter, Vanessa Carlton. She fills her album tracks with songs that mean something. Some would call it angst Rock n' Roll/Punk music which is true. But I find it soothes my soul listening to her talk about her search for herself and someone who loves her. Anyone can relate to that feeling. There are also many excellent guitar riffs that keep the music moving. This is definitely something to blast from your car stereo this summer like I so often find myself doing. Whether you are younger or older this is a CD that you'll want to hang on to!",1

Those interested in hearing what the Irish-American experience has been like, will be pleasantly delighted with these songs. All of these are sung well, with great conviction (However, I've heard a far more rousing version of ""Finnegan's Wake"" by Tucson's The Mollys on one of their cds; the cast's rendition of ""Finnegan's Wake"" isn't as riveting a performance.). Personally I found the CD far more enjoyable than the video; so if you have to choose between the two, I would strongly recommend this CD. Erin go bragh!",1

"I like it more than my cats.

This is my favorite scratching post. It's not the ugly rope/carpet combo, so it's aesthetically pleasing rather than an eyesore. However... neither of my cats like it as much. I've had it for about four years or so, and it still looks practically brand new (whereas their rope-wrapped cat condo and other post are torn up and falling apart from scratching). I've moved this thing all over trying to find their favorite scratching spot, I've tried catnip and playing around it, but no dice. They just aren't into the woven sisal... they'll walk over to the rope posts instead. Every so often they'll scratch this, but I guess they just don't get as much pleasure out of it.So on the upside, it's tall enough for your cats to get a good stretch and scratch, if they actually like it. And it's the prettiest scratching post out there. I just wish my cats liked it more!",1

This book is not a love story. The most intense relationship is the one between Gabriel and ""the second man."" There's been mention of homosexual overtones - I think that is a bit overstated...the real story is not between our lovers, but how much hate and fear Gabriel has that needs to be overcome before he can love again. Frankly, there was little heat between the two main characters, I don't think they even kissed before page 200.

The zipper is first rate, and you know that is not the norm with most coin purses. Hemp is super flexible and it can be folded to match the size of whatever is put into the purse. So when I have a lot to carry, it lets me with no questions. And when my coinage has lost its turgidity, I just fold it up like a hankie, and it works that way, too.

"Too fast, too hot!

I received this slow cooker for Christmas last year and have never been happy with it. The first time I used it my dish boiled and burned so I thought it was broken. My husband called Rival and they said they hadn't heard of this problem. We sent it back and they sent us a new one. I have used the new one a few times and same problem. I checked out this sight and reviews out of curiosity and it certainly confirmed my experience. My mother's very old avocado green crock pot works so much better than this new one. The only nice feature of the new one is the removable crock but ease of cleaning doesn't justify a lousy overcooked meal.",0

We purchased this Kensington power inverter just before we drove from Oregon to Québec.

Our cell phone charger worked just fine so I will assume the inverter could not handle the load from the laptop power supply.Later on our trip we purchased a Jensen 160-watt inverter and that works just fine with our laptop.A shame because the Kensington had a sleek profile which was easy to store and fit well under the bucket seat with plenty of room for adequate ventilation.",0

"There's an easier (and cheaper) way

The addresses and phone numbers in this book are handy, but this is not the way to find an agent or publisher. Instead, visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre. Look in the ""Acknowledgments"" section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author's agent and the book's editor. Those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published. Find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site (anywho.com, dogpile.com, etc.) and give them a call. If they are receptive to your idea, send them a formal proposal.I have to agree with those who have suggested that publication of a book like this by someone in the business smacks of exploitation. As one other reviewer noted, the author is an agent - call him up and see how receptive he is to you. You might as well try looking for Elvis in the supermarket.",0

An in depth account of the horrors of Germanys KZ camps in WWII.Dr. Nyiszli was spared the gas chambers because of his pathology skills and selected to work closely with Josef Mengele. He was the doctor who had to preform autopsies on all of Mengeles experimental victims.One may question how a decent person could participate in those types of things, but one you read Dr. Nyiszli's story, you will begin to understand the choice wasn't his to make.Dr. Nyiszli was one of 4 men to survive the 12th Sonderkommando revolt, and one of the few Sonderkommandos to survive the camps, as the SK were systematically executed after working in the gas chambers/crematoriums for 4 months.This is a compelling, heart wrenching story about one mans struggle to survive the horrors inflicted on millions, how he helped others when he could, and a chilling glimpse into the mind of the ""Angel of Death"" Josef Mengele.",1

As the product itself highlights the 3D format, I will refer only to comment on this issue, as the film itself is very good and the soundtrack is the best.3D content: 3D is the least I've seen ... the truth see the 3D version will detract from the film, the 3D effects are negligible, I think where else to note is when the world of the grid, the camera takes very mint shots from the floor and it looks a little depth of perspective.

Dr. Shaffer attempts to address the difficult topic of data structures and fails. Consistently he glosses over important points, or does not describe the implementation of data structures (the buffer pool, for example, is especially poor) adequately and leaves the hapless student confused and frustrated. For a computer scientist who already understands the subject this book may contain a few good points. Indeed, I was able to follow the sections where I had previous training, but when I studied material new to me, I was out of luck.If you are unlucky enough to have a university that uses this text, consider trying to find a better book to get yourself an adequate understanding of this important subject, because Dr. Shaffer's text won't do that for you.",0
"The final word on the final battle

You have to read all three of the Ryan books to get a better understanding of WWII. All three give a wonderful perspective of the war at turning points in the war. This book shows how relatively untouched Berlin was until the Russians began their assault. Interviews from top generals to milk men are conducted and insight like few historians could offer. The Russians extract their revenge with a program of rape on all German woman. Ike is cautious about invading the capital because of rumors of secret instillations in Southern Germany. The Germans want to surrender to the British and Americans, therefore leave the Western regions virtually undefended for a quick Allied invasion. It goes on from there, but why ruin the book. The best thing to do is begin with Ryan's ""The Longest Day"" then ""A Bridge Too Far"" and end with ""The Last Battle."" Maybe the best thing about Ryan's books is that all three compliment each other and can be read separately without any problems.",1

"Bare Minimum

I bought Bullet Witch back in the fall of 2009. I fully cleared the game for all achievements and then put it away as soon as possible. I wanted to like this game, but ended up only liking the main character. It seems they poured most of their budget into her creation and rushed everything else. It seems like they originally intended to create a different game. I say this because the levels are not always linear, yet often you will reach a dead end that has nothing of interest; nothing to kill, nothing to pick up... just nothing. The graphics are subpar, the environments are not detailed and the enemies uninspired. Also, the enemies are recycled over and over. I remember mostly relying on 1 gun to beat the game on all difficulties. Basically the end product was a good start, a rough draft, nothing more.",0

"Red Majesty

Red glitter lips never looked so defiantly good as when Hedwig bursts in and starts roaring her anthem. Like a caped crusader wrapped up in the American Flag, she is her own hero. She wears her wigs and makeup like a 1980's rock star who knows what it means to have to fight to make her voice heard. Hedwig capitulates the very essence of rock and roll into the less frequented venues for such finery with as much tranny flair as humanly possible.Hedwig's one goal is to be a star and on her journey she creates one through Tommy Gnosis. The sweet seeming Christian boy who steals her heart and her songs leaves her performing in random restaurants where the majority of customers look bored or even disgusted by her presence. For them, Hedwig is someone they endure. They can't relate to the pain six inches forward and five inches back creates in a person. Nevertheless, Hedwig insists they witness, listen and look at someone society often shuns.",1

They're quick to point out Republican klan involvement in 1920's Indiana, but manage to turn a blind eye to the Democratic Party's klan involvement in the South. It's a valuable lesson in how bias can come in the form of OMISSION. Unless that's your purpose, I strongly recommend avoiding this DVD.",0

After reading Open House which I enjoyed, I immediately got several of Berg's other books. This book is a disappointment. The main character is weak and stuck feeling sorry for herself, and many of the other characters (Elaine and Mark) are not well developed. This book feels like it's from another era where women didn't know how to deal with their problems and get what they really wanted in life. Yes, Patty gets her baby, but what about dealing with all the relationship and career issues in her life?? While Berg generally promotes close female friendships, I had problems with Elaine's lack of loyalty. Aren't some bonds more sacred than getting the man? Skip this one.",0

The writing style indubitably makes the otherwise not so hard concepts (which I later realized from another book) seam indescribably esoteric.If you are a beginner to Radars, I suggest borrowing this book from somewhere and going through it, and I guarantee, that you will not buy it. My very sincere advice is, get ""Matlab Simulations for Radar Systems design"" or any other book from ""Mahafsa"" and you would be pleasantly delighted by the fascinating world of Radars and in the end way more knowledgeable.",0

"Very good mp3-cd player

This cd player is great for playing mp3s. It stores well over one hundred mp3s on a single cd to play anywhere. At the beginning and middle of each song it copies 2 minutes of the song to it's internal memory; the cd actually doesn't spin while it plays that part. This makes skipping virtually impossible. The sound is very good and there are several different equalizers to choose from. The only downsides to the product is the software doesn't have instructions with it (Adaptec CD Creator 4.0). Plus, when the cd is started, it takes about a minute for the first song to play, while the software loads. After that though, the music is continuous because it only has to load one time.

I bought the book and forced myself to finish it because of the review. Really, if it were by my choice, I would not have read the book. It is (as you will find out, by this author) all about an abandoned American town which (if you were like me, a Hopper's fan, you would understand it) is a classic example of decline of a suburb. It is an economical as well as a cultural decline (if there was any economics or culture). I am not here to compare... We all have a choice as to what to read. For me, it is like an expired strip mall. When you drive by, you get a nostalgia feeling... inevitable, helpless and depressing.

The way it is written as a conversation between Mary Summer Rain and her friend, Sally, allows you to be a part of their back and forth questions and reflections on subjects like personally held beliefs, ego, meditation, personal power and always this underlying existence of serenity. You can reflect on the questions and thoughts that are presented and see how these play out in your life and what may be driving away the serenity that can seem so elusive. I read this book more than a couple of times over the years. Revisiting Fireside is helping me to see what I have forgotten and reminding me of personal work that I need to keep conscious.",1
"Great book for an aficionado.

This book was pretty interesting and had a lot of detail to the history of manufacturers. My one complaint about the entire book is: I would have liked it if a 4th Edition were available, with updtated manufacurers and their histories. The author is very proud about his knowledge and definitely comes across pompous. I would recommend it to a cigar smoker...but at these prices for the 3rd Edition...I think you can do without the information.",1

"My Opinion Differs From the 6 Previous Reviewers

My mother used to enjoin me, ""If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."" If I follow her advice, you won't know why I didn't enjoy the book. I bought it, so I finished reading it. If I'd gotten it from the library, I'd have returned it without completing it. It might be a discussion piece for high school English class or a book club - to analyze and discuss for effect, characterization and plot - but the characters never engaged me and I found the plot plodding. Overall ... tedious, and the people small and unsympathetic.",0

"Not Worth the Money

If you plan on spending loads of money for airfare and a hotel in order to get to the TEA test location, save some of the money by not buying this book. The practice exams were fairly simple and the math section was completely unrealistic compared to the actual test. I am by no means a math wizard, but this book portrayed the math section as one of mostly very basic math. The actual test is 10x harder! Ill be buying ARCO's guide (US Marshal test book) for the next time. Several people told me after the exam Arco's math section closely resembled the actual test.",0
"Not Kelly Kapowski

"Mother Daughter Book Club: One of My Favorites

This warm, inspiring book offers perhaps one of the best ideas ever - creating a mother-daughter book club for preteens in the service of building a communication network for those tough adolescent years. In the process the growth among both moms and daughters is lovely and the suggested books on the money. It suddenly occurs to me that it's kind of a predecessor to Reading Lolita In Tehran in that it is structured around meetings of the group over the years. I've given away countless copies.",1
"excellent for keeping out silverware

I gave it 4 stars not because it was faulty, but because it doest fit all disposals. I had a kenmore originally, and it fit perfectly. I had to get a new disposal, a waste king 8000, and the screen was too big. I filed it and sanded it smooth to get it to fit the new hole. other than it not fitting all disposals, It works perfectly.An update, I just changed it to 1 star, the fins/ strainer has cracked in several places, not completely broke in 2 yet but any time soon the center handle is going to break out of it. Its center is too weak, if a pot or glass goes into the drain it puts stress on the strainers center. Apparently its not designed to stay in the drain and pile any dishes in it. Kind of defeats its purpose of keeping stuff from falling in the drain if you cant put anything it the sink anyway.Im currently looking for a better replacement before it breaks all together and my wife grinds up my silverware in my new disposal. save your money.",0

I have had this for only 3 or 4 weeks, but have made many batches of ice cream. It works great and is easy to use and clean. I leave the freeze part of it in the freezer always ready when wanted. I have actually made one and half batches with it before it defrosts, but you have to have your mixture real cold to start with.

"No good for pasta

Pot and insert are too short for the diameter. Pot with insert must be filled all the way to the top to have enough for things like spaghetti, fettucine, linguine and the like.

"Very Poor Book

This book was a big letdown. It is nowhere as good as ""The Puzzle Palace"" by Bamford. The author rambles on and on and presents ""facts"" that are really nothing more than wild conclusions based upon his conspiracy theories.

"the LP companion piece

To say IMA ROBOT has what it takes to be the next big thing is thoughtful. To say IMA ROBOT make music that moves me is an understatement. To say this band could overturn the kings of sound, fashion and rock in the next year is not debateable in my mind.Some of the best riffs, compelling beats, songcraft and lyrical/vocal delivery ever. Blend Bowie androgyny with Lydonian sensabilities, caffeine devo - electro -(you know Lydon wanted to sing for devo as soon as the pistols broke up and there are some 'pistolized devo moments) - to solid backbeats with enough style and chops to lay you out and you have synthesized the ultimate electric rock band.To say I have become emotionally attatched to this and the LP is merely veiling my true convictions for this stellar band.Buy or be totally ignorant.",1

"Muslims are afraid of the truth captured in this research

This book truly unpacks the MAJOR flaws in Islamic faith. I would suspect that any TRUE Open-Hearted truth-seeking Muslim would give serious second thought to their faith, once they get through the first 50 pages. The references are a mix of Western and Middle Eastern, ... but believe it or not, the most devastating evidence in this book comes from well known and respected Middle-Eastern Muslim scholars.The author presents an accurate account of Islam (Middle-Eastern) vs. the ""Black Muslims"" or Nation of Islam (Farrakhan's cult) and how the true Muslims regard the Black race as damned. (If I were black, I'd think twice about saying I'm a Muslim, Malcolm X was very noble in this regard and should never be forgotten!)I gave the book a 4 out of 5 because I would have preferred a more gentle demeanor (for Muslim readers). Nobody likes the truth rammed down their throat and I think there is a bit of harshness in the tone of the writer.",1
"FAR superior to a fan!

My ""significant other"" offered to take me and my two sweet Granddaughters (3 & 5 y.o.) to Chicago for a long weekend, but I seriously considered not going because I knew there was NO WAY the 4 of us could spend the night in the same hotel room due to his EXTREMELY LOUD snoring -- we'd ALL be horribly sleep-deprived! After at least an hour of research on the internet for ""white noise machines"" at the 11th hour, it was clear this was the winner hands down, and I ordered it (OVERNIGHT DELIVERY...cost me an extra $25.00!), but I can't tell you how well worth it it was!! Worth EVERY PENNY! We ALL slept like babies all 3 nights! Now I have to give mine to my daughter because my Granddaughters don't like the fan anymore! I just ordered one for her. BUY IT!

"Josie and the Pussycats

Josie and the Pussycats was a cute film. That's about all I can say. There wasn't really a plot, which is fine, because half the people that see this movie will probably be 13 year old girls. The acting was good and points, and REALLY tired in others. Some moments are funny, but others seem to fail to capture the fun and imagination that the cartoon had.The film follows three singer/songwriters who happen to dress like cats. They hit it big, and have to adjust to their new surroundings. I think I summorized in 2 sentenses what took about and hour and a half to explain in the movie( that should say something).One of the reasons I found the movie to be stupid, was because they were going against what they were preaching. They try to fight against commercialization, yet the movie is a walking promo for Target, Ray Ban, and other major companies.Parents rent this for your kids, but take my advice and leave the room while they are watching it.",0

Clearly this film is not a documentary. It is a well-edited propaganda piece based on a particular point of view. Moore does a good job of making his points, not significantly different points than the typical Sunday news program, with the exception that there is no attempt to show both sides. As a one-sided view, this appears to be a ninety minute advertisement for the Democratic party.

I graduated from this wonderful institution known to all as The Citadel, to some as Pure Hell, and to the Mace's as their fumbling fortress. It is a total sham, everything in that book except for the names and locations. Those are true, but unless you were there at that time, or there at all, you will never get the truth. Conroy's Lord's of Discipline held more legitimacy than this book. And we all know when a book is written by 2 people, the first person spoke and the second person actually wrote.There has yet to be a truly accurate depiction of The Citadel- maybe someone with a little bit of INTEGRITY (part of what the Citadel stresses) will set the facts straight. Until then, this book may give a few good laughs, but all in all, its more of a wive's tale than anything else.",0

"Suitable for children.

Lacking any intelligent dialogue or acting, this once-popular Fox Kids show made into a motion picture is substancially better the TV series, with OK special effects and some suitable comic relief. The plot is lacking any suspense and has barely enough interest to pique the interest of adults (the Rangers are played by young adults, considering the roles they play). The Power Rangers are played with lightheartedness, the roles not taken very seriously. But the plot, special effects, excellent costuming, and comic relief keep this from flopping as a remake of 1993-1995's popular childrens' show. Passable family viewing, considering its PG rating.",0

I generally enjoyed Jones' rehearsing of the sexual pecadillos of various secular intellectuals, and how they used their work as a justification of their illicit sexual behavior. Little known facts were revealed, though many of these items have been collected elsewhere.But then, at the end of the book, Jones launches into a viriulent attack on Martin Luther as the root of all of these problems, outrageously claiming that Luther's doctrine of the bondage of the will (similar to doctrines found in Augustine and Aquinas) was developed virtually solely as a justification of Luther's breaking his monastic vow and getting married. Jones actually claims Luther is some sort of medieval Hugh Hefner!

Before reading this book, I had no idea what Phillip Pullman's personal positions on faith and religion were and that was pretty much what this book was about -- variations on the theme of ""Phillip Pullman wrote this series as a rebuttal to C.S.

Unfortunately, this one did not reach that same level of interest. I found the majority of the essays to be rather simplistic and very little of what I read made me think. It was illuminating to hear the underlying philosophy that Pullman brought to his writing, but I would have liked it if they essayists had not all addressed this same topic but had instead looked at other aspects of the books",0

The ""Patron Saints"" Set tells the life stories of many of our most popular saints such as St. Anne, St. Francis, and St. Therese. There are also less well-known saints including St. Albert the Great, St. Erasmus, and St. Rocco. Each card also features the feast day for that saint and what he or she is patron of.The ""Saints"" cards illustrations are simple in style but have an appealing aspect to them. I believe that these cards were designed for children but they are very informative for adults as well. This is a wonderful way to be introduced to some new role models.",1
"an important voice for genuine masculinity

This is an excellent book. It's a plea for men to get involved in their churches, and for churches to welcome a distinctively male approach to church life.This book explains why many men are repelled by church from effeminate ministry, to flower and creche rotas. Men need clear niches and roles within the church, and not to feel that they have to hide their masculinity away when they get to church. When they have to do this they would sooner be anywhere else.This is a well written, well observed book that describes well the problems many men have with many churches. Some of the criticism are sharp, but the message from this book is necessary and timely.I highly recommend this book to those who run churches. I recommend it to men who want to understand their reaction to church more fully. It may not be your fault that you don't feel at home in church.",1

"Didn't get the job done...

I recently started a project that required an upholstery needle (12"") to attach a button for that 'tufted' pillow look. Let's just say, it didn't go well. These needles are tragically dull and unable to pass through muslin or quilting cotton (which is an impressive failure). With quite a bit of force, and bending the needle in the process, I finally got the needle through, but it just wasn't up to the job in the long run.Maybe I just don't understand upholstery needles, but I was disappointed with these. I don't think I'll be going to these for further upholstery projects.Needless to say, I love every other Dritz product I own.",0

"Great Story ruined by annoying author

The actual story that is supposed to be told would have been a great story. However, the arrogance and poor writing style of the author made me cringe every time I turned the page. The fact that the story about the unlikely successes of a team turned into a story about the author's 9 month vacation in Italy was a shame. This must be the first book I've ever read where I literally couldn't stand the author and the only thing that got me through the book was the underlying tale of this incredible soccer team.",0

"A book full of mysterous things

I think that this book will make wonder what might happen next and how will it end. Who is that person and why are they doing this and that. This book urges you to read until you get your mysteries answered, even then more things happen that make you wonder and with what I knew I conjured up an answer and read on until I found the stories conclusion. The book it self has a scare and twists back to clues you dont even rememeber. Then you dont know of what point of the book you are at. Reading this book was great it kept you thinking and wondering what would happen next.Till you get to the point whee the book jumps around and becomes confusing to the point you dont know how crazy and nuts Poe really is. Mixing everything together avi wrote a great book that keeps you guessing till the end. I reccomend this book to any one who is willing to keep reading.",1

This book is a good introduction to Mowat. It is one of his early books and will be appreciated by all animal lovers. It enhanced my knowledge of and respect for wolves.

"Mystically Fun

Lara Peale is recently divorced in the last year, and the last thing she wants is a controlling guy to run her life despite the many times her bestfriend has tried setting her up with someone. Mark Vereker works for the local historical society and has just recently called it quits with a busy body in town. It's Lara's thought to renivate her new home (which she gained in her divorce) that brings Mark Vereker in her life. It is by a letter which is found that starts a string of a haunting attachment to Lara and Mark. Jennifer Malin has such a great talant to capture the magic in the fist chapter. If you like mystical love, or haunting romances, then grab yourself a cup of coffee, a warm blanket and enjoy. You won't be sorry! :)",1

"A suspenseful surprise...

I thoroughly enjoyed Margin Call.It was suspenseful and fascinating watching a fictional account of what most likely took place at one or two financial institutions during the beginning of the GFC. The director did a good job reflecting the diversity of motivations between self-protection and corporate/social responsibility. Jeremy Irons character was truly outstanding in his merciless disregard for others, whether they be his employees, customers or the general populace. He simply didn't care. Modern day evil.This movie isn't for everyone. I think one probably needs to have some interest in the particular events, the corporate world and/or financial merry-go-round of the investment world.",1

"""OUR JOURNEY WAS THE DEVIATION""

In the months leading up to the Second World War, two women travel from Switzerland to Afghanistan to study an elusive nomadic tribe in Kafiristan. Writer Annamarie Schwartzenbach and researcher Ella Maillart embark on a journey that is both physical and emotional as they discover their own hopes and dreams. Unfortunately this film failed to capture my interest and was rather dull. Aside from the stunning cinematography of the Middle East and the (very) sexy Annamarie, JOURNEY TO KAFIRISTAN is a slow story with little insights of the human condition to offer the audience. I hesitate to recommend this film to others.",0
"Very nice

"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK

Shame on Cuisinart for putting on the market such a piece of junk. I'm trying to learn to be civil, so I can't use a more appropriate four-letter word than 'junk'.There's an obvious manufacturing flaw that ineffectuated both of the machines I got from Bed, Bath & Beyond. The funnel-shaped filter holder is spring-loaded at the bottom and requires pressure from above in order to drip. However, once the water had dripped just a tiny bit, not enough pressure was exerted and the coffee machine stopped dripping!I called Cuisinart, which had me on hold for twenty minutes before sending me to a very, very rude CSR who fully exuded her boredom, impatience and supercilliousness towards me. Then she simply said, ""you gotta take it back to the store"". So I did, only to be given another one with THE EXACT SAME DEFECT.Thanks Cuisinart... for nothing! I always thought you made aesthetically nice products BUT WHO CARES IF THEY DON'T WORK!",0
"Ghosts, Goblins, and Glory...

You may not know it, but Maximo is a sort of sequel to Ghosts and Goblins and Super Ghouls and Ghosts. Obviously, gaming has changed much since the days of those titles, so the game has been updated significantly, and yet somehow it still feels like its predecessors, which is an accomplishment worthy of notation. The gameplay is suitably mindless and addictive, and will tax your reflexes at every turn (and sometimes your temper as well - but that is all in the Ghosts and Goblins tradition, is it not?). Unlimited saves or continues would have brought this game up to date and made it more player-friendly (when you've used all your saves and continues, you're going to have to start from scratch), and some of the levels are too similar to one another, but Maximo is a fun ride while it lasts, and comes recommended to fans of platformers and arcade-style action games.Final Score: B- (or 4 stars)",1
"You Can't Put It Down!

Amanda and Mark Reynolds are two people very much in love. Their future looks bright and rosy until a series of events finds them realizing how very little they know about one other. When they must move to the small town of ""Potter Springs"" their lives become even more complicated, and their marriage begins to crumble.This is a wonderful book from debut novelist Britta Coleman. Her prose is woven intricately in this beautiful story about love, loss, forgiveness and redemption. She makes you care deeply about these two people and the eclectic mix of characters she's created. There are times you laugh, others when you cry, sometimes all on the very same page. This is an incredible read you can't put down. It's in my top 10 for 2005.",1

"Reviewing the remixed versions of Ann Nesby

After listeneing to Nesby's I'm Here for You, several tracks fall within their own standing, such as I'm Still Wearing Your Name, Hold On, and Can I Get a Witness. After searching extensively for several months for any remixed version of any of these tracks, I located Mousse T's remixes of Can I Get a Witness and Hold On. It goes without saying that a true lover of music will greatly appreciate the thin bass lines and high vocals so beautifully placed on these remixed versions. Nesby's articulation and Mousse's T's remixing are too compatible for words. I believe it would be very difficult to obtain a copy of this maxi-single currently, but any price is worth this house-dance masterpiece",1
"Best John Wayne Western EVER, hands down.

In interviews, Patrick Wayne has stated that ""The Duke"" thought of this as his best Western, if not his best film. His catchphrase in this one has been further immortalized on TV by ""Jethro Gibbs"" (Mark Harmon) on NCIS. ""Don't apologize, it's a sign of weakness."" It's a guy flick, but some ladies may like it as there is a bit of romance. My lovely wife would rather do needlepoint than watch Westerns, so we won't share her thoughts here. All in all, the Wide-screen transfer was fantastically done, the panoramas shot in Monument Valley are some of John Ford's best stuff cinematically. Would have really suffered if it had been done in black and white. The color is exceptional. Another early John Wayne & John Ford collaboration in color I HIGHLY recommend is ""The Quiet Man"" (I'm Irish and watch it each March 17th with some Old Bushmill's on hand.) Buy it and ENJOY!",1

Plus the teflon is scraping away after less than a year. George, can you go back to drawing board and give us a grill that we can actually wash???",0

Maybe I didn't understand the title correctly, but I only got the bearings them self. When I opened the package, I noticed that the Inner diameter and the radius to the face of the bearing casing had a lot of porosity.

As far as the price if all I was supposed to receive is the bearing this is by far not the cheapest way to go and I could get a lot better quality from another vender.",0

"Not so Inspiring - I expected more from a talented writer...

A clever thought, poorly executed. I would have preferred a different ending, rather than a traditional Christmas one that we find in ""It's a wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Story"". Maybe it would be considered black humor, then, but hey, why not go out on a limb and try something new?I've read a few of John's books, great page turners, false drama created by not telling us who the ""evil"" person behind the story is. And then in one chapter, the person is exposed, and whammo, its over. Nonetheless, I enjoyed those books and that's what counts!This one, however, was just too stereotypical, predictable, and after a while downright tiresome. I really enjoyed the first half of the book because it exposes the mass consumerism rampant during the holidays, something we all should reflect upon.I say, read the first half, until their daughter calls from Florida, and then toss it.",0

I installed these on my ""under the sink"" cabinet where I keep my household cleaners. My daughter is now old enough to open the other cabinet locks, which is fine in respect to the pots and pans, but I defintely don't want her getting into anything dangerous. I love these locks because I feel sure that she cannot open them since we keep the magnet up high and the lock is very strong. They lock automatically when you close the door, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to do it. They are also much more convenient to open than other cabinet locks, which is a bonus for my husband and I. The only complaint I have is the installation process. The instructions are not the best and it takes a lot of time to install. However, it was worth the trouble in order to make sure my daughter cannot get into dangerous chemicals and the fail-proof safety is worth the price!",1

"One word to describe this book: bloated

SOMEWHERE in the publishing world, there must be an editor with the guts to tell Tom Wolfe:1. He needs to cut this book by at least 30%.2. The first time he uses a metaphor (""winking navels""), it may be clever; the second time it may be a slip up; the third time it becomes a cliche; the fourth time, annoying.3.

Unless I'm mistaken, this version of Duke Nukem (3D) came out a couple of years after the PC version, yet the graphics and animation were much better playing this on my old 486dx2-66 at the lowest graphic mode settings. This PSX version is really ugly, and I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to having fun playing Duke Nukem again after all these years.

Thomas Jane as Mantle is great and shows the demons that caused Mantle to be who he was during his playing days.

If the activities made sure people did not tresspass, had safe hiking trails. and respected the cultural resources. then maybe but it has no regard for local culture, to reveal Maui just ask a local.

I don't get why Chinatown is such a well respected movie. It is slooooow. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson. Every scene is long and drawn out often with no dialogue to keep it interesting. Half an hour could have been shaved off this with no real loss. I mean do we really have to watch him climbing over a chainlink fence for 5 minutes. No! But the biggest beef I have is with the direction. The filming of the ending scene which everyone always says is so great is all jumbly and amateur looking.I never really got to form an attachment to any of the main characters, they seemed more like modern actors self-consciously trying to embody certain film noir types.If you really want film noir go to the true source-- forties and fifties films like Panic in the Streets, the Asphalt Jungle, An Ace in the Hole or Laura.The only true heir to the film noir mantle in modern cinema is ""The Usual Suspects.""

"Mediocre effects, preachy, disconnected plot

First, the visual effects were pretty weak. Think ""Made for TV"" movie and thats about right.Second, the story seems to stop and start. Very disjointed.

There is little flow to the film, its almost like the scenes were their own episodes with only the thinnest transitions.Third, talk about preachy. Big bad Magisterium controls everyone and everything and is harming children only opposed by the last ""light"" of the world, a college. Yeah, ok. I mean we all know that colleges are beacons of enlightenment, I mean the frat parties are BRILLIANT. Come on, I'd like my indoctrination to have a modicum of sanity.Bottomline.

"Works good after replacement

I got a version 2.6 wireless USB adaptor and it didn't work after installed the driver on WinXP. Bascially the adaptor was able to detect the internet connection and see the computers on the network but the connections are super slow. I spent 45 min waiting for tech support from Linksys and they told me that there's something wrong with the board and asked me to fill out a RMA online. The next day I dropped by the Linksys office and got a replacement of my bad board. Good customer service. The replacement works good although it's a refurbish unit. I'm still having problem playing Divx file through a network PC.",1

"Just a Frazetta's shadow.

Hoffman's work is just a pale imitation of Frazetta's talent. Being myself an artist I cannot understand why people that is already established in the art field keep trying to copy somebody else's work.

I recommend you to get a Frazetta's books first.",0

"A lot of fluff, not much substance

For me the best part of this book was Appendix A, entitled ""XML Language Basics"". This should have been the first chapter in the book. But by the time I got to it, I was pretty fed up with reading about ""emergent behavior"" and other buzz phrases. I did get a bit of a sense of what various acronyms mean, such as SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, J2EE and so on, but the ratio of fluff to substance was too high for my taste.",0

This fax works...at times. Sending faxes have been ok. But I've had a lot of paper handling issues when receiving. Like the first 2-3 inches of the fax not displaying because the paper was not feeding properly.However, the greatest knock on this product is IDENTITY THEFT. To print your fax on plain paper, the fax uses a black ink film. After you used up on film roll, you will discover a nice archive of all the faxes you have received viewable on the film roll. So, don't have any one send any sensitive information to you on this fax.And, shredding the film roll will gum up your shredder. ;-) Believe me, I'm talking from experience on this one as well.",0

"Not a Good Book

The book is titled ""Creating Wealth Through Probate"". I'm not a highly experienced investor, but I'm certainly not a newbie. I've read 3 real estate investing books in the last month or two and this is the worst of them. In fact, I'm actually not sure if I should try to sell it on Amazon because I don't want someone else to waste their money.If the book is about probate, talk about probate. ""Tales of Probate"" and Appendices are great, but they have little value in actually achieving wealth through probate. The author does talk about probate, but he also goes into real estate investing in general. This was a mistake. There are many, many books that discuss this topic. All of the books that I've read on real estate investing are better in content and go into further detail. No need to beat a dead horse.",0
"just an advertisement

I love Dr. Seuss more than anybody. I have almost all of his books. I was so very disappointed with this book. I searched for it while I was pregnant with my first child but could only find Oh, The Places You'll Go! which I love. When I became pregnant again I finally found this book only for it to basically be an advertisement for all the other books. I guess I had expected it to be meaningful like Oh, The Places You'll Go! So for anybody out there that is expecting it to be similar, it is not. It is probably a good book for most, but for me it was just a disappointment.",0
"Fast Little Board

ProsThis board is a excellent perfomance board.I bought it with a barebones setup and had to replace the one that came with the case(dont ask why, too embarrassing). It is a micro AXT board, made for smaller cases.ConsThe manual does not give enough information on all BIOS setups. If you are experienced it is adequate.As a micro board, the problems you might imagine are present. I run 4 hard drives and the video card almost butts up against one of the drives. The wiring harness definitly get in the way of memeory and hard drive hookups.If you put this board in a regular sized case, you will have little problems with the connections and harness's.Also to note, while not advertised for some reason, this board does support 6 channel modes for 5.1 speaker systems.Over all I am very happy with the performance, it is set up to run dual core AMD processors and is 64 bit",1
"Excellent Performance & Recording, But It's Live

Having long been a fan of the 1973 E. Power Biggs recording of these two concertos on Columbia, with its stately majesty and glorious acoustics, I was intrigued to run across this budget-label release of the same two rarely-performed pieces. Curiosity impelled me to purchase it.It's really quite good. The pace is taken a little slower, which does not diminish the grandeur of the music, and the organ and orchestra sound really terrific with lots of thundering low end and powerful dynamics. Certainly nothing in the performance falls short of the requirements of the music.I was a little surprised to hear some coughing in the quieter moments and polite applause at the conclusion. It doesn't markedly detract from enjoyment of the performance -- in fact it emphasizes how terrific the performers are, to be this good without editing -- but nowhere on the cover is it mentioned that this is a live recording.",1
"Great Hendrix CD

Target should definately pull this product.. and stand behind it for their customers...

He stumbles about in a haze due to the fact that he has no long term memory: ""Who are you? Where am I? Oh yeah, I wrote down here somewhere..""It gets worse, everything is shown backwards, so we see what happens to the goofball in the end, which is the beginning, but it does'nt matter.

"Repetitive, uneven, and full of poor grammar

This critique isn't so much about Mssrs. Chand and Talbot as it is about Apress. The quality control used in the publication of this book was atrocious. The book was obviously rushed to print (come on guys, you're new to a market with some tough competition, so use your spell checkers and hire professional proof-readers with experience in technical publications!) The writing style is too conversational and colloquial, reading more like an undergraduate end-of-semester project report than a professional reference text. Properly presented, the approximately 850 pages of information could be reduced to about 600.That said, there is a lot of good information here. The authors have tackled some tough subjects (the section on creating custom data providers was especially helpful, but their treatment of the currency manager could have been more in-depth). My advise, however, is to wait for the second edition.",0

I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.

"A tiresome way to spend an evening.

Crushingly dull. The characters are bland and too poorly drawn even to be irritating. The plot is pedestrian, with details that are neither relevant nor even entertaining.

Now it seems that if the writers get stumped they just throw aliens at you. I think its very upsetting when you are expecting an explanation that you couldn't see coming from a mile away.

I bought the original of this watch some 4 or 5 years ago. It's beautiful. But at least twice a year, there is a disaster with the band: a pin breaks, one of the caps on the side pieces comes off, the clasp loses one of its tiny springs, etc. When I travel, I have to take a spare watch because breakages are so frequent. The repairs are expensive; sometimes they take quite a long time (10-12 weeks, even at the authorized Movado shop in Tysons Corner). So, as much as I love the looks and of course the mechanism, being quartz, is fine; but the utter lack of reliability makes this a terrible watch.

The one standout song on this album is the heartfelt ballot ""Alone"" existing as the album's only shining star really as the rest of tracks are boring and a bit dry.

"First Lehane novel, couldn't put it down

Great story, fairly quick read, enjoyed the plot twists. I liked that it kept me guessing but doesn't string you along to the point where it becomes obnoxious (e.g. ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", where you feel like it should be done but there are still 200 pages left). Still a couple of questions unanswered and a couple of seemingly pointless scenes (or maybe they provide a context I missed), hence my 4 instead of 5. I appreciated the ending because I felt like it was the only one that would be appropriate.",1

"Skip the capitol xmas album, get this one instead

I'm a huge sinatra fan and expected the capitol sinatra albumto be a swingin' affair. I've grown to appreciate it over theyears but it doesn't come close to the Reprise Sinatra ChristmasAlbum. Album covers a period from the early 60's through themid 70's. What I like about this collection:1. It's in chronological order2. Great arrangements (sorely lacking on the capitol album)3. Great choice of songs with a nice mix of the secular andsacred.4. Hard to find stuff like Christmas memories and a baby justlike you.Skip tracks 8-10 and you've got a perfect sinatra christmas collection.",1
"The Outsiders

In a world of poor and rich, greasers and soc's; Ponyboy and his brothers are stuck in the middle. Together with his brothers Ponyboy learns that regardless of their social class pain hurts; even the Soc's just can't erase the pain even with their money. Knowing that they are too smart to be greasers, but too poor to be Soc's, they and their close friends stick together.All is well until one fatal night that tears them apart. Their lives will never be the same.I think S.E. Hinton did a wonderful job of elaborating the details and humanizing the characters.In think you will love the book. You don't find many good books about young boys trying to take control of their lives.",1

If you ever need to take indoor shots in succession, DO NOT buy this camera. I loved my last Canon and went with this one which was newer, but in the same series. The recharge time for the flash is terrible between 7 & 15 seconds and really makes a difference when you're trying to capture the perfect shot. The reason seems to be that this model only uses 2 batteries. The A620 is entirely worth the extra $100 since it has 4 batteries and the fold out screen.",0

I've been a real admirer of Dassin's work-- and Melina Mercouri is a force of nature, irresistable. But this movie fails at every level-- as narrative it makes no sense. And Mercouri crosses that fine line into being a Grotesque, a camp parody of herself. Many of Mercouri's lines are indistinguishable, even played over a high-end system. It's as tho' half the script was never shot and the film they had on hand was quickly thrown together into a ""movie"". So much talent involved here. A huge disappointment.When oh when will they release the DVD of ""Phaedra""--the crowning achievement in the Dassin/Mercouri output ? RR in Tucson",0

I have to agree with the other two reviews... this guide tells me NOTHING that I couldn't have found in the manual. The sad part is that, when I looked online, I easily found two game guides (at IGN & firingsquad.com) that are VASTLY superior to this one. And they're free.Since unit statistics are now available from in-game windows, what's the point in half-filling this ""guide"" with them? The only reason can be padding. As for the tips, they're laughable.I'd heard great things about the M:TW Guide, which is why I bought this one. Don't bother. Visit IGN.com or firingsquad.com instead.",0
"A healing book for these troubled times

I just finished reading ""The Stardust Lounge"" for the second time. At first read, it is a riveting, albeit, troubling journey of a devoted mother and her out-of-control son. The book is unsettling in it's raw, unabashed exposure of the power of the dark tunnel through which many adolescents pass - both male and female. As a counselor who has worked with adolescents for many years, I know, first hand, that the author's experiences are much more prevalent than most parents, and society in general, would like to admit.The ultimate power of this book, written in a seductively honest, often poetic style, is the message of the true nature of healing. Anyone who has been through troubled times - and who hasn't? - will find their answer in this book.",1
"Best NiMH batteries to date

These batteries do their job - they hold their charge remarkably well (for both low and high drain purposes - they're perfect for just about anything), and they're pretty much the only NiMH batteries I've ever had that actually hold more power than their 2000mah advertised capacity - mostly all of my eneloops hold around or over 2100mah.Compared with regular NiMH's (of which I have plenty as well) - which almost never hold their advertised capacity but either slightly or significantly below it - getting these is a no brainer.The plastic case that comes bundled is actually quite useful for carrying them around (e.g. as backup batteries for your digicam).One thing I'd point out is that the price of 2 4-unit packs appears to be consistenly lower than one 8-unit pack, and having two 4-battery plastic cases is probably more useful than one 8-unit plastic case.",1

"Not the best poetry, but Ursula is still distinctive

Like her prose, Le Guin's poetry is thoughtful: every word is magical, reflecting the sort of dependency on words that exists in her Earthsea books. This belief in the primacy of language certainly makes her a better writer.

As other reviewers said, the toy is disappointing. On the surface it appears very cute, but is very hard to erase (even for an adult!) My greatest disappointment was in the terrible noise it makes when the mechanical eraser creeps back up on its own.

"So Very Predictable

I read this book as a teacher; it is a South Carolina Junior Book Award Nominee for the upcoming school year. I must say that I LOVED Flipped and was eager to read the next book by this author. However, the plot was mediocre and predictable (I saw the climax at least a few chapters into the novel.) and the characters were flat. Van Draanen had sketchy details, relied too heavily on unique Southern expressions to carry the book (most of which fell flat), and the characters themselves are not motivating or interesting.

There is however one good song titled ""My everything"" which is more like their old stuff.I can understand when bands mature and broaden their musical styles, but only if it leads to a positive outcome and not when it seems like it has been made for a mainstream audience which is when I say a band has ""sold out""If you havn't got any of the cds, get self-titled, hangups or stomping ground.

"Very disappointed!

This series is described by having an unlikable main character as an unusual hero. That could have been bad or different. The show comes to be mostly bad. You expect this is a mecha series, which would mean plenty of action. Honestly that is included, but it feels like everything else comes first. Going back to the show's first season it would have been better if the 2 or 3 main characters, Hayase, Emi, and maybe the Juda Corporation president were almost the only ones. Instead a team of more annoying Juda members make this a series of odd humor where robots should be. Although you could still say it has it's moments. As bad as it is, it's not bad enough to rank in the worst I've ever seen. The point is this is really bad, but short of the worst.The animation is good, what you would expect from a recent show. This is almost certainly a show to avoid. I was so hopeful it could be the next great series, and it turned out to be everything else.",0

My child and I enjoy the bright vivid colors of this product. Not to mention, you can take the velcro off and on and create a different environment each time.

His play room is complete with this set as it's a great addition for spontaneous, creative, and exciting playtime. The tunnel and slide are both great and the structure itself enables a child to stand correctly and even walk. All of his playmates gravitate toward this item when over for play. Cleans well too..disinfects with diluted bleach with water and/or mild soap and water. Both ways of cleaning has not affected the color or durability of the item at all. Great Product!",1

I try overwriting the files, and that doesn't help. I'll delete everything and start all over, only to be denied.Now, to take the cake, it has gone from a 2 GB player, to a 700something MB player.

These really are wonderful. I discovered them when a waiter at Gary Danko brought me a taster of Hendricks Gin in one a few years back. I immediately set out in search of the glass. Obviously, these are for drinking neat rather than on the rocks. (I tend to add a half of a small ice cube - chills it a wee bit - allows that extra bit of aroma to mingle with the liquid - works for me.)Do they enhance the flavor of scotch over other shapes of glasses? I have no idea. It's probably more marketing than anything else. I still dig 'em anyway.Just a small note: I bought these to replace a few of mine that had been broken over time. These are slightly larger than those I bought the first time around. Not by much, but noticeable. Base is slightly differently shaped. No biggie, really. Just sos you knows.",1

It could never freeze solidly.I called to get a replacement bowl and was told that not only would I have to pay to ship the old bowl back, but I would also have to pay for them to ship me a replacement bowl.

There's nothing in here that's really applicable to anyone who's not a ""distributor"" or a ""sponsor"" with a ""group"", and I'd rather be roasted over hot coals than become one. The only reason I'm not returning the book for a refund is that it'd probably cost more than half of what I paid for it just to ship it back. I gave it one star only because the color scheme of the cover is nice.",0
"HKS Magazine Speed Loader

I think this would be a great product. If you could get one that fits the mag you are wanting to load. I have ordered two of these and purchased one from a sporting good store. None have worked. I want to load a 40 Cal Smith and Wesson Model 99 (8 round mag) and a 40 Cal Styer (12 round mag). I followed the makers recommendations (for size and fit as printed on the back of the prduct card) with all of the loaders. The mag is either too big or too small. They will not seat in the loader so that you can hold them and load them, one does not even fit the loader. Unless the maker is going to make one that fits these mags I am still loading by hand. So far this prodcut for me has been a waste of time and money.",0

"Not worth the paper it is written on

Wher can I start? This is a story that could have been great. The plot and the book, if written by an experienced writter, could have made you awestruck. However, Haydon makes you wonder if the publishers even read the book before it was printed.So many loose ends, so many plots within plots, made my head spin. If you are one of the few lucky patient ones, you will get a little bit of surprise at the end of this first volume. But it is a surprise that is just not probable. I am not going to spoil the book for those who still want to read it so I should stop right here. A word of warning, I know that there are not many good fantasies being published lately, but you can wait a bit longer and spend your money on better things for now.",0
"Not for me

Been using this for awhile now because I refuse to waste it. My skin type: combination dry/oily areas/fair/sensitive/acne-prone. This face wash drys my skin out terribly. I hate that tight dry feeling I get after using it. Sure I feel like it is taking the makeup off, but at the loss of all my skins natural oils and moisture which it really really needs! Lately my skin has been so dry and flaky so along with the colder weather and dry indoor heat this stuff is wrecking my skin! I hate it. Definitely does nothing to clear my acne, if anything it makes it worse. I will not be repurchasing this product.",0
"I am still lauging!

This is a hard film to describe, and may not be for the meek of mind or heart. It is a satire of immense and completely insane dimensions.

I am still laughing when I think about the gang bangers getting romantic with the ""she-monster."" This film is an original.",1
"Excellent and readable resource!

'To Marry an English Lord' is a well-researched and accessible book about the phenomenon of American heiresses marrying into the British aristocracy. Crammed full of facts, lists, photos, and informative text, this is the first book people should read if they are interested in this milieu. The text is easy to read and nuggets of history are presented with enthusiasm and humour. Despite the light tone, the authors never talk down to their readers and present their information without exaggeration or sensationalism. The book was carefully researched and the included bibliography is an excellent resource for further study. I am pleased that this well-deserving book has been brought back into print and encourage anyone who enjoys the history of this time and place to purchase it immediately!",1

I actually found myself skipping to the end to make sure things would be somewhat ok before I could finish it & I never do that.It's a good book, just not a book for me. A little more romance & a little less drama please.",0
"narcissistic ramblings

I am a huge fan of Elvis Costello but not of his new album.The first thing that bugs me is how he just keeps using the vibrato in his voice. It's as if he thinks the more he usesit the more feeling he's emoting. It work the opposite with me....if the songs had any substance he wouldn't have to try to dress them up with the endless vibrato he uses.Another thing is that the songs are virtually indistinguishable from each other.....apparantly he has found a new love in his life but it might have just as well been he was diagnosed with some bad disease.....there is no joy here. His chord changes on many of the songs seem forced and disingenuous...like he's tryingto do something artistic. As I mentioned I think he is a tremendous artist but I feel I wasted my money on this disc...if I had sampled it first I never would've purchased it.....",0

"Yawn...the CIA should pay for this publicity!

I read this book before enrolling at the CIA. While the descriptions of the school are fairly accurate (it is a very stressful environment and there are many passionate and talented students and instructors), the writing itself is insipid and seems to pander to the CIA's teachers and administration (and indulge in more than a fair amount of ego-stroking to boot). What Rulhman seems to lack in his overly abundant coverage of the food industry and its players is a really compelling story. His florid descriptions from everything to making stock to the mache in the walk-in bespeak a writer suffering from thesaurus overruse rather than an interesting plot or an artful writing style.",0

"Negative 5 Stars

This movie moves much too slowly. I could only last 40 minutes into the movie with absolutley nothing going on, no plot development whatsoever and really long shots that serve no purpose and should have been edited out. The scenes are much too ambiguous to make any sense out of them and feel too staged. You would think that if someone was running away from danger, one would tell the other person exactly what one was running away from, and not spend an afternoon in a hotel doing absolutley nothing. The Polish accents and forced speech patterns added to the annoyance factor. It's like ""Polish Wedding"" set in the future.Don't waste time on this one.",0

I haven't changed my eating habits...too busy...but am still losing inches and toning up in places I've never toned up before. Especially my abs, butt, and arms. I highly recommend this program. I used to go to the gym, but had gotten lazy the past year or so. This program is great for beginners to those who already work out a lot, just want to work out at home. It takes very little equipment and space. It does take time. With 30 minutes of cardio added, the workout takes me a little over an hour and a half, 3 days a week. It moves to 4 days a week of strength training as you get closer to the 12-week mark. It's really motivating and I plan on looking great for my wedding!",1

This album is VERY much like a Crosby, Stills, and Nash album. So much so that I am giving my copy to my mom, I think she would like it.

I love Cirque du Soleil, but this is an amateur Cirque at best.I've travelled to LA (Saltimbanco) and LV ('O') to see them and have bought many of their shows on DVD, most of which I love. I watch them with my 3 year old daughter who adores them despite the fact that they don't have animals and despite the fact that the Cirque is predominantly for an adult audience. She nevertheless can tell me, by title which one she wants to watch and we agree that Saltimbanco, Allegria and Quidam are our favourites. So when I popped this one into the machine you can't imagine our disappointment. Pathetic and amateurish and a DVD which should never be seen by anyone, let alone sold to an audience. It seems like a few school kids playing Cirque in a cheap school hall environment, there is NONE of that Cirque magic. Don't waste (a lot of) money, rather buy one of the previously mentioned and you won't be disappointed.",0

This is the part that I found misleading when I came to purchase this item, and there was no information published about it, on Amazon, that would have helped me not to purchase this item, as it did not correspond to what I was looking for.

I didn't like the way that the author kept skipping back and fourth from janie to Reve.

"Pass this fictional trash by...

The methods described in this book sound foolproof. First, find tenants with stable jobs, no self-esteem, and with no clue whatsoever about economics. Then get them to rent from you under the most oppressive of leases.The book assumes a market where good housing at a bargain price is plentiful, yet demand for rentals far outstrips supply. At best this is a paradox. There is no way the vast majority of renters would accept such outlandish terms that the Milins propose unless vacancies were virtually nil.The financial information was quasi-useful and the only semi-bright spot in an otherwise very dim book.The Milins come off as complete 'holes to deal with as buyers, sellers, and landlords. I'm surprised they find enough who will do business with them to keep FIVE houses occupied, much less the hundreds they brag about having.This book belongs in the fiction section.

Feet of ClayFrom first breath to last drumbeat, this CD has kept me enthralled for YEARS! It's a non-stop favorite among my friends (who regularly request I play it whenever they visit). Oddly enough, it's one of the few CD's that my 20 year old niece, 4 year old granddaughter, and I can always agree on. I recommend this CD to everyone who wants great music in their home!It's such a shame that Bottomland no longer plays together.",1
"unstable

Do not buy this product, I figure it was a good idea because the pin style could not possibly fail. However, care was not taken when constructing this product. The bottom plate is about 1/4"" steel and the welds sure penetrated well, but the welding overheated so much the bottom warped and both jackstands are not flat. The corners do not touch the floor just imagine how little of the bottom is actually making contact with the concrete, mostly only in the center, not my idea of safety. I checked with some other people with similar style jackstand made back in the good old days possibly in the USA too, and theirs is flat. In my opinion if the manufacturer cannot avoid warping then the bottom should have been machined flat and using a thicker material to begin with.",0
"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT DOESN'T WORK.

I bought this to avoid having to spend the money on lip waxing and eyebrow waxing every few weeks. It was a 45 dollar mistake. I can never get any hair off, and end up tweezing.

Keep looking!!!!!!!! Don't waste your money!!!",0
"Not as bad as the other reviews make it sound

When I first bought this item I was really scared because of all the bad reviews that it got on this site. I decided to get it anyway and let me just say it serves its purpose, works well in my car and on other radios, it looks great and matches the ipod really well. The two different modes work well and the dial on the side makes for easy station selecting which is a nice change from having to have to songs on your ipod. So if you are planning on buying and itrip for your ipod don't worry about these negative reviews it works well.",1
"probably effective but can only fit US plugs

It is probably effective, but the down side is I ordered it from Singapore. The product info didn't warn me about the plug - it couldn't fit our wall power points, and even after I used an adaptor, both (I ordered 3 and opened 2) blew and can't be used anymore. Totally a waste of money for me. My advice is if you aren't from the US, forget about ordering this. I should have just spent the money and bought the more expensive ones (but international brands) sold here cos once you add up shipping charges, the costs were almost comparative.",0
"Two worlds

Come experience two worlds that never really meld into one. A Chinese daughter of immigrant parents who tries to live in both worlds, old China (her parents may be here in the States, but never truly become part of the culture) and the USA . She finds she cannot live in both worlds without deep resentment and frustration and opts to reject her parents old ways in the end. This was an excellent view of the frustration and pain for both sides involved. Gives you a view of those who live in America, but are not really a part of it.",1
"video quality leaves a lot to be desired

I'm going to give this two stars instead of one because Eric Johnson is an incredible guitar player and I'd even watch an Eric Johnson concert in black & white.The camera work is pathetic. Also this was intended as a home video release, so why was it shot in 2:35:1? Concerts are shot in 1:85 or 1:78. Not only does the camera work suck but the quality also sucks. I realize that this DVD probably wasn't given the same buget as say The Foo Fighters BluRay or The Police Certified but the Jeff Beck DVD that just came out blows this away.I've seen Eric Johnson probably a half dozen times in concert and he's never played for less than 2 hours. So why is this DVD only about an hour of music?The standards have gone way up for what a concert DVD or concert BluRay should look like and this falls way short of expectations.",0
"...zzzzzzzzz...

...I can't believe I fell for the $10.99 pre-release gambit. A waste of money... my bad. I'll be surprised if this does indeed make it to theaters. This movie was a complete bore... with mild, long padded acting scenes, very little 'suspense', and iffy special effects: moving shadows. Wow! :-( The religious overtones and lack of explenation toward the 'non-ending' left me, well, a bit angry. It's difficult for me to even go into 'review' detail, as there was so much non-event during long stetches of this film. I suggest you wait until it's availabe for 'free' on Netflix if you are curious... that'll save you money, and time - if you decide to cut it off and fall asleep.",0
"There for the next generation....

I don't own the SNES, but a friend does, and I've played it. I havn't been gaming since the beginning of the series, but I was captivated by Ocarina of Time, and have been trying to track down the other Zelda games and try them out for history's sake and to find out the storyline. So the graphics are pathetic, compared to the N64. But I've seen the graphics of the NES, and I can tell that the SNES was as big a leap from NES as N64 is from its predecessor. But to the point. This game was really fun-it equaled up to , possibly even bested, some of the other Z games. So, I rate it 5 stars. ZELDA FOREVER!!!",1

"So many errors!

I made the terrible mistake of touring Idaho with an old (1994) edition of the DeLorme Idaho Atlas. Fortunately I had a whole sackful of BLM and Forest Service maps to get me out of tight situations caused by relying on DeLorme's information. The atlas shows roads that are not there, and does not show roads that are there. The land management boundaries are incorrect in many crucial instances, and sites are drastically misplaced.I very much like the additional topographical information in the new edition, but I also noticed they did not correct any of the cartographic errors. So-- fine for casual use or for general trip planning, but contact the BLM or Forest Service before you head out on the back roads.",0

There is no such thing as the ""gay agenda"" that the right-wing likes to complain about so much.

"Well-paced and exciting, but character development falls flat.

I've read _Election_, and I went into this book hoping for more of the same--developed, interesting characters and a plot that kept me guessing. Unfortunately, Tom Perrotta has apparently become the next incarnation of Dean Koontz, complete with the action-packed unrealistic ending and the flat-as-a-pancake Evil Guy. People just don't behave the way that the characters do in this novel, especially at the end.I enjoyed the writing--on the whole, Perrotta is a very talented author and deserves to do well. I think, though, that he can do much better than this book. When I finished reading the novel, I actually threw it away because I was so frustrated with the shallow character development and the typical deus ex machina ending (in this case, the ""god"" was somehow in the characters' heads, making them behave in ways completely unlike the people who they were supposed to be). I've never thrown a book away before.But this one deserved it.",0

"The Beauty Within the Tragedy

Like all the Kerouac novels, the overriding point of this book is to show the beauty that lies within the tragedy of human life. Though Kerouac is ""depressed"" through most of the book, sickened by the people and places and travel which he once found so necessary, he finds mental respite in his mother and her unconditionally warm spirit, among other things. Another point which Kerouac strives to raise is religion. Though he and his friends more oft than not live a wild and consumptive life, Jack still remains devoted to the idea of God and the genuine goodness of people. This book, just as all Kerouac novels, describes life with a wide-eyed vivacity unlike anything I've ever read, if only in a less sunny way.",1
"Loved it .......but

As an ex-Australian soldier watching this film, I have to give it the usual critique of ""American hype"", however I've read the book by Mark Bowden, and have to say that as a soldier's story it is quite true and quite graphic. Australian soldiers were in Somalia at the time too as part of the UN peacekeeping force. I enjoyed the fact that it didn't deal with the political framework, as mentioned before it is first and foremost a soldiers story. As stated by Hoot (Eric Bana) near the end of the film; ""it's about the man next to you"". But I think the film could have done without the chest-beating by Josh Hartnett at the end. I was a little disappointed that the film did not depict the Somali riflemen, RPG men hiding behind, underneath, in a crowd of women and children as in the book; that's what these young soldiers had to deal with. Oh, and don't watch this if you're in any way squeamish.",1

Anyone who believes that we fit into a bigger picture - regardless of which particular religion - will find value in this book.Gallanter leads the reader on a great journey that conjured up Stephen King-like characters. A throughline of jazz - both literally and figuratively also recurred throughout the book.Enjoy!",1

Rachel Yamagata is truly a rare talent. The most notable thing about this all too short EP is her voice. Imagine a combination of Fiona Apple and Alanis Morisette (without the quirks) plus a healthy does of smoky nightclub. The instrumentation is subtle and compliments the music perfectly. There's some accoustic piano and guitar, the occaisional programmed drum kit, but it's all sparse and doesn't take away from the striking vocals, strong songwriting and achingly emotional lyrics. I think Rachel is an artist with long-term potential and will be with us for years to come. This EP is especially recommended for fans of John Mayer, Fiona Apple, Macy Gray, Etc. You will love this!",1

This movie starts with Leonard (Guy Pearce) shooting a man you later find out is Teddy. The movie is told backwards (and I was told that at the beginning as kind of like a caution) so I thought the whole movie is going to be leading up to that scene. Little did I know about the strange plot twists and almost too thought out of a script. Christopher Nolan (Screenwriter and Director) excells in every aspect of writing a genius script. The dialogue is very real and the characters are fully developed. There isn't one reason you shouldn't see this movie, unless you're under the age of around 12 because of the violence and lots of profanity.

"Very fine version (but not quite stunning)

There have been so many awful (let's face it) recordings made, that this truly inspired work can seem at best, hackneyed, and at worst, utter dross. The major problem has usually been an almost Wagnerian approach to the singing (even in the choruses), and an orchestra that was both too large and too modern for the task.Here, at last, we have a version that uses period instruments tastefully, and yet with all the vigour we might have experienced when Handel supervised the first performance in Dublin. Perhaps the ornamentation is a little safe at times (oh for some really adventurous repeats!), but there's a lot to like about this performance, not least the phrasing and highly musical sense of line, and evocation of the lyric context (certainly the most emotional aspect of the work, when performed well).If you have yet to hear as Handel intended, then this CD is highly recommended!",1

The schrader valve connection has a rubber gasket inside that will deteriorate after a couple uses, causing the connection to leak and make the gage useless.

The earpiece is on a swivel attached to the speaker, which does not position the headset in a consistant manor. If I can't keep the thing on, there's no use going any further. Iogear needs to put some extra thought into this problem.",0

There final comment was to ship it back.We arranged for a replacement, but instead our money was refunded.",0
"A little disappointed

I really wanted to like this book as I felt the subject matter was so timely for what I've been going through, as a single, childless, woman in her late 30's. However, like many other reviewers said, it mostly fell short for me. I've tried, multiple times, many of the things the author suggests. Much of the book was written for women with children, however, I did read the entire book despite this fact. I consider myself shy and there's even a chapter about that - but I gleaned nothing from this chapter that I haven't already tried without much avail. I do think the author means well and although I really ""liked"" her, from what I could glean as she wrote about herself, I didn't find this book to be as helpful as I'd hoped.",0
"Terrible navigation control

Navigating the table of contents is a nightmare....every book is followed by a list of chapters so picking a book usually involves turning pages and searching through chapter numbers to find book titles...and the first chapter link on every book is broken...selecting chapter one of any book causes my kindle to turn a page...I'm very dissapointed...",0

"Rosenblat Does Superb Job At Reading

I've been an audio book listener for over 10 years now and have come to realize that the reader is almost as important as the writer. In this story, Scottoline came up with a fairly predictable plot that was fun and easy to follow. You can easily identify with the main characters and end up putting yourself into their shoes from time-to-time. What really makes this audio book stand out is Rosenblat; she has a wonderful voice and acts out the characters much better then most readers. I especially liked the Pigeon Tony's lawyer's (Judy) closing statement. To avoid giving you the ending, I will say that Judy's words were poetry in a courtroom! Enjoy! 3 stars for the story, 5 stars for the reader.",1

"Loved it!

Sonny Bono has done it again in this funny book. To me, he's never stopped me from laughing at him because I have seen his variety show with Sonny and Cher and I can't stop laughing at him. He does have quite a sense of humor. He and Cher have been one of my favorite singers from the 60's/70's, even if I'm only 29 years old. I was introduced to Cher in 1998 or so before he died, I think. I did get to see her when she was doing the Farewell Tour in New Mexico, so the drive wasn't that far from my state. The reason I said not far was because I do live in the 4 Corners. I am an avid reader so I do enjoy the music history from the 50's - 70's and it stops there so yes, I do know a lot and enjoy it but I have lost touch of it lately sadly but I haven't lost my touch. This was a funny read but it does make me wonder what Sonny would've thought about his daughter turning into a man. That scares me!",1

"Not very useful or informative

I found this book to be lacking in information as well as very repetitive. Much of the information she includes is no different than what can be found in a regular pregnancy book. In addition, she feels the need to define words that, in my opinion, if you don't know the definition of, you should probably not have gotten pregnant. Also, this book is in desperate need of a revision. Nothing huge, but in the section about bed rest, she references watching videos on your VCR as well as programming your doctor's number into your speed dial.",0

I usually only write these when I enjoy a film, I was excited I love thirties gangster films especially the Dillinger era. This film never got off the ground, whoever edited it did a horrible job it did not peice together at all i really wanted to like it, but it really sucked. Everybody is different but this film poorly done the acting was mediocre, the story never got going once you thought it was it went a different direction, for 4.00 watch one of the old B films on Dillinger with Warren Oates pretty cheesy but much better than this terrible film.

A friend of mine whom I worked with in college radio turned me on to the track ""Papa Poppa"" with the comment, ""Does this not sound like it'd be a GREAT Guess Who tune?""

Over the years I've lost a few of their other albums but managed to hang onto this one...I'm rebuilding that collection now that I know I can again!

"Tons of useful information in this book

As an old DOS programmer who is finally getting into Windows programming, I found John Mueller's book to be indispensible. Although the book covers a wide range of topics, it is easy to hone in on a specific topic that you are having trouble grasping.The explanations of background concepts are just enough to bring you up to speed and make the source code examples clear enough to follow easily. The chapter on Active Directory services is worth the price of the book all by itself.",1

Tony hawk underground is a pretty fun game. It is actually pretty easy to get good at, and the story is probably best in the series.

In the story, some goals had to do with dumb things like driving cars or climbing building. personally, i bought this game to skateboard, not drive around. also, you have to spend ALOT of time trying to find lines, and get good. i feel so bad when i go online after getting beat by 1 million points. anyways, pretty good game, and kinda addictive.",1

On the back it said it's recommended for ages 5 and up (I doubt it because when I saw Sailor Moon Pegasus collection #3, Fish-Eye(part of the Amazon Trio)was in a dressing room with this ugly guy and the suit she was wearing had needles in it so she tore it off (YUCK!!!)!!!!)

"Helpful for wheat allergies

Good information on how different grains behave when substituting for wheat. Disappointing for Italian recipes. I am allergic to cow's milk, but tolerate buffalo milk mozzarella, which is what it is made of in Italy (Mozzarella di Bufula). The book makes no mention of this important substitution. Also, Pecorino Romano, like imported Feta, is made from sheeps milk, not cow's milk, as stated in the book. Sheeps milk yogurt was not mentioned either. Unfortunate since many people are turned off by the strong taste of goat milk products. Also, some people will tolerate foods that are cooked as some proteins are denatured or broken down by cooking. The book makes no mention of that. Also, some people might not tolerate tomatoes, but can tolerate a mock tomato sauce by pureeing red roasted peppers with or without artichokes as a sauce base. Most of the tomato sauce recipes contained tomatoes. Still the book is very thorough on grain substitutions.",1
"Just how did that body get in the library?

I bought this book after watching the recent ITV adaptation of it, which left me suspicious as to whether the ITV denouement was as penned by Agatha. My suspicions proved correct.I'm not sure why ITV felt the need to change the original ending. Agatha Christie's is better and far more credible.I know she has her detractors, but I still think her plots are far cleverer than people give her credit for. With its twists and turns, its subplots, mazes and red herrings, The Body in the Library is up there with the best of Mrs Christie.The Night of Harrison Monk's Death: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 1 (Volume 1)Pandora's Box: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 2 (Volume 2)A Game of Cat and Mouse: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 3 (Volume 3)April (Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 4)",1

"Not a keeper

I bought the audio-tape read by the author. I hope she is a better speaker than a books-on-tape reader. I found her delivery nasal and flat. It was unpleasant listening to her.The content was thin, included too many quotes, and came off at times as self-congratulatory. If I didn't think conversation skills were important I wouldn't have bought the tape. I didn't need to hear over and over how important being a ""conversensation"" (her much over-used term) is to social and business success.I listened to this tape twice (the second time to verify my impressions) and then got rid of it. It was a waste of money.I found a much better tape on the subject in ""The Fine Art of Small Talk"" by Debra Fine.",0

This is a wonderful book. After hearing about all the things my son wouldn't be able to do, and how he'll never fit in etc. Here's a book that takes those ""bad"" traits and shows me how he can be sucessful with them. This book gave me hope for my son who was diagnosed very late (age 9) with Aspergers Autism.

I know people who are schizophrenic and this book does not accurately depict schizophrenia, it's causes, or it's treatment. This book needs to be taken in historical context, it was written during a window of our history when the causes and treatments for schizophrenia were understood in a different way. In fact, many people were diagnosed with schizophrenia when they actually had other illnesses, contributing to this confusion..Beyond this, it is a beautifully written work of story which I think is a classic.",1

"Seeing demons where none exist

As an Indian-American, I am totally disappointed with this book. Apart from terrible typos, the book also suffers from terrible imagination. At a time when the relationship between India and US is getting better, the trade is growing and they are both getting closer in terms of their world-perspectives, the author's attempts to paint India as villian is not just inexplicable, but downright dishonest. He does the world a disservice by painting one-sixth of humanity as bad guy. If you must buy this, do so to laugh at the author. Also keep in mind that characters and storyline are figment of the author's demented imagination.",0

Compare this movie to the Alien Movies where the special effects were also inspired and something to talk about but the special effects were the supporting cast to a great story.

"Not impressed.

This is the story of a young girl who questions death and the hereafter, following the passing of her grandmother. While the questions are important, the story isn't very well-written, and the conversations aren't very realistic, in my opinion. I believe that, if the book were written by an unknown writer, instead of by a Kennedy, it would still be in an editor's slush pile; possibly even in their garbage can. The book's illustrations are beautifully rendered pastels, each of them including various shades of blue, invoking heavenly feelings appropriate to the title. While death is a difficult subject for any child to deal with, I found this book to offer overly simplistic answers to complicated emotional questions. I wouldn't recommend it for a child who is seeking answers about death, or who is dealing with grief.",0

First of all, I think Celine is a great singer with a very good voice ... but this album just doesn't cut it. It contains too many ""sleepy"" songs and she screeches when she hits the upper octave (i.e The Reason, Treat Her Like A Lady) and sings with all the nasal-voice she is able to muster up (i.e Immortality and probably everything else!) The reason that this CD will sell-out is because of ""My Heart Will Go On"", propelled by the movie. Celine should go listen to ""Falling Into You"" once again ... listen to the material and how she sang (skip the nasal, celine!)... and do a repeat performance of that.

I don't think there's anything remarkable about her journey or insights (at least until half-way through Indonesia, which is where I gave up on this incredibly vapid memoir). I think it was the incessant whining that really got me. The reality of divorce recovery is such a far cry from the self-indulgent ramblings presented in this book that I don't feel Ms. Gilbert deserves any kind of congratulations.

"Nice quality... when it works

I am so glad I decided to check Amazon before going out to buy another new cartridge!

I had been disappointed in my Z42's print quality from day one, but assumed the ink levels couldn't be the cause since they were nearly full. I kept cleaning the nozzles, realigning, and contacting support... I finally gave up and replaced the cartridges, and only then did I see the quality I had been expecting. I realize now the cartridges that came with the printer were dried up when I bought it. I don't need to print often, but who would expect that printing less would cost more?! I doubt I get 50 pages per cartridge, and more than half of those are the ruined pages and test page after test page... THANK YOU SO MUCH for the suggestion of soaking in cold water - that did the trick!",0
"Elizabeth

This movie is fine if all you want is a costumed drama, but since I've very familiar with the actual history, I found the liberties taken with historical fact absolutely unconscionable. If Elizabeth I were alive today, she could sue for libel. Go back to Glenda Jackson for real historical drama.",0

"What a Mess!

I normally don't write reviews because I'm a firm believer in ""To each their own."" However, this movie is just a mess. I loved the 1st POC, love Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast is fine, but the plot/editing is dreadful. The 2nd movie wasn't as good, but I liked it. This movie is rarely as fun or funny as the 1st POC. It's really hard to believe that this movie did as well in the theatres as it did. Don't waste your money.",0
"Useless

I really wanted this to work. Five minutes after I put these on the window my 10 month old climbed up on our ground level window sills and pulled them right off.

I hadn't even heard of Brent Jones til about 2 years ago. Seems like the hottest in gospel are always the most undermarketed.This is an interesting CD. The different elements of music that he uses are awesome. There's the jazz tune of my favorite track ""Much Love"". The slow jam tune of ""Sindy""... A wonderful CD. Although I like his other CD - ""Beautiful"" - better, this is a keeper as well. It's not traditional gospel AT ALL in any manner and I love that.

"bad science, bad fiction

I have tried to read this book three times. The characters are one dimensional. The science is laughable. I put this book on the same level as the star trek book of the month. There is nothing to it.

Instead of character development the author puts in page upon page of technobabble. I can't understand his popularity.",0

As usual, Goldy Schulz, caterer cum sleuth, manages to solve the murder while producing sumptuous feasts, this time in a castle, battling her ex-husband, and agonizing over the return of her husband's old girlfriend.

I simply wanted to say that this book is nothing like Trials of Tiffany Trott or Making Minty Malone(Books others bought). They are humorous and sweet but I found Ralph's Party to be coarse and no fun.

I couldn't even finish it but I did skim thru to the end and I really don't think I missed a thing. Any ladies out there who like Isabel Wolff I think Marian Keyes is more our style.",0

What a relief and joy to listen to work uncomplicated by over-the-top doodads, super effects, and gimmicks. This music and musican is decorated with straight-forward honesty, power, talent, and HEART quietly enhanced by producer Jeff Fair...the best recipe for any artist's work! All I can tell you is that I begin listening with my mind in the typical daily buzing mode most of us share, but by the last track I am so much more centered while feeling empowered by the infectious, confident, strength of the playing combined with such sensitivity.

Being a nyc hispanic native i know this film is true in its essence. the performances especially by nolte are fabulous. nolte should have at least been nominated for his portrayal of a nyc corrupt cop. if you have lived in nyc this is a film that you should see for its location scences and gritty story. one reviewer wrote what did the main character (hutton) see in her, i can tell you she was smoking hot in the film. i am surprised i have never seen her in anything else and that is a shame.. there is also a touch of humor especially when the evil nolte meets his maker. however the scene between blumenfeld(character) and hutton towards the end about things being buried is very haunting in deed considering the atmosphere that we all live in this society.",1
"Did the author ever watch the show?

I picked this book up at the dollar store and feel ripped off. Wow this was bad. It reminded me of fan fiction that was written by someone who had never seen the show but had heard about it.The problems began with the premise. Halloween is supposed to be dead vamp wise. I was willing to let this go because it might have been written before that fact was established, I don't know.The BIGGEST problem for me was the bad dialogue and the fact that for halloween Willow died her hair red from brown. They talked about how good she looked as a red head and how it looked better than her normal hair color. It was at that point I shut the book unable to read any more. The author had no idea what the characters even looked like. It was just such a shame.",0

I had to use this for a class and boy was I dissapointed. This book relies more on words than examples.

I paid over $300 for the DE 400P. It worked OK for about 8 months then the pump stopped working. The only reason I was willing to pay so much was for the pump. Delonghi service people have been NO help and argumentative. They tell me I must ship it to NY for them to repair. The packaging and shipping costs alone make this prohibitive. I asked to speak with a manager and got voice mail. I left a message 3 weeks ago and did not get any return call.

The title of this Arli$$ release seems to indicate that it is the first of a series of ""best of"" DVDs. The surprising thing, however, is that I was unaware there was enough ""best of"" material to even fill a single DVD, let alone a set of them!The longevity of Arli$$ is inexplicable, just as it was unbelievable that Suddenly Susan ran for so long in NBC's coveted Thursday night lineup.

This has got to be the worst movie of it's type (big budget, big stars) I have ever seen. A complete [distruction] of Terry Southern's hilarious 60's novel, it captures not one of the laughs, not one of his comical characters and none of his satirical wit. The movie was deservedly savaged by critics and avoided by moviegoers. The best excuse I can find for it is that it was made during a time of many studio restrictions. and could be a truly funny independent film today.",0

I made the mistake of trying to move a dresser across a hardwood floor with these sliders. Despite the floor being recently washed and waxed and cleaned with a vacuum prior to moving the dresser, some grit (maybe from the bottom of my shoes) was on the floor and stuck to the bottom of these plastic disks (that's all they basically are) and put several scuffs and scratches in the floor.

This book has some great ideas buried in it but the total disregard for any form of reality or research makes this book almost comical.I had signed off Reilly a while ago but got a free advanced readers copy for this book and being immensely interested in archeology and ancient civilizations decided to give it a try. Mr. Reilly's complete disregard for any of the physical sciences does disservice to what could have been an intriguing novel. I had to try and come up with so many harebrained excuses as to how most of the action and settings could take place that I was completely unable to maintain any suspension of disbelief. It obvious that when Mr. Reilly comes to a point in the story where some form of fact checking or research is needed he pretty much just makes something up to keep the story moving along.I'm the first to admit that some realism needs to be sacrificed for good story telling but this book doesn't even begin to attempt to balance the two..",0

With this velcro band it feels like a different watch. I can now wear it 24/7 without discomfort. It has softened with age (and getting it wet)and formed to my wrist. I often forget that I am wearing it, which is quite a statement considering the size of the Vector. Although I have only owned it for about two month's, it seems to be VERY durable!

I tried getting into the second book of the series, but I just really do not like Harris' story writing. I prefer precision in my books with vivid detail so that I can map the characters and places in my mind. I found that I'd open the book, read a few pages, and put it down. There just wasn't anything to hold my attention. My personal opinion is that season one of True Blood did a much better job with Harris' story than Harris managed to do herself.

I would have given no stars if possible.The clock arrived poorly packed, with no paperwork and broken.The face of the clock is the cheapest, flimsiest plastic you can imagine. In addition the face came off, was in several pieces and there was a broken piece that goes around the clock face.I have had other similar clocks, but none was as cheaply made as this. The glass itself was ok. It was the clock part that was BAD!",0
"Humorous but inaccurate

The inaccuracies which plague this book are many. The author has allowed a vitriolic personal bias against Christianity to take the place of historical accuracy. In addition to the stunning inaccuracies, the venomous, contemptuous tone of every reference to the Christian faith is problematic. In this day of tolerance, it is surprising that anyone would allow their personal prejudices to be so visible and so hateful, especially in a book for children! In a book which is supposedly based upon history, it is surprising that anyone would print out-and-out lies such as are found in this book. Why did I give it two stars? Because the text, when it is not too busy attacking the author's imaginary archenemy, is refreshing and useful. It is humorous, winsomely written, and fun. The illustrations are great, too. It's sad that the author's personal biases have marred this otherwise fine work.",0

"Disappointing quality of music and motor

We purchased the Tiny Love mobile, but were quite disappointed in the poor quality of the classical music. It gives a distinctly out of tune, 'tinny' quality to the music.Additionally, the sound of the electic motor that powers the mobile was so loud that it overwhelms any music that's being played. Not exactly the ideal environment for a baby to fall asleep under.However, the toys were well done and are sure to entertain most babies.",0

The whole movie was completely pointless with hillary duff dancing around like some maniac. There is only like one scene in the whole movie without hillary and the plot is completely unbelievable. The only highlight of the entire movie was the extremely HOT italien rock star, Paulo Valisari, who in my opinion is the only one that can act. Yet, the only decent character turns out to be evil in the end! I guess fans of the series will enjoy the sometimes romantic parts of the movie. On the whole, the movie was bad, but if you like hot foreign guys and hillary duff, i guess u may enjoy this film.",0

This disc has one purpose - to make your TV look like a fishtank.

"A Massive Work of Scholarship with Many Nuggets of Surprise

As the author notes, this work began as a doctoral dissertion at Harvard, and that quality of research is apparent on virtually every page.

In its field, ""Art as Politics in the Third Reich"" is the greatest eye-opener since Lynn Nicholas produced the first of them, her masterful ""The Rape of Europa.""

"Yawnnnnn...

I am not opposed to pop-clasical crossover efforts (e.g., I like most of the Opera Babes CD), but see no point in this album. ""Shapes"" offers very sleepy versions of mostly over-familiar classical/baroque pieces, none improving in any way on conventional, unmodified performances or other pop-classics efforts. (For example, compare the fine performance of Satie's Gymnopedie #1 by Blood, Sweat, & Tears with Miller's emotionally/sonically flat version.)Also, Miller's guitar performance displays nothing of his musical personality (maybe he has none). Dom, if you're going to do classical pieces, you need to play them straight, or add some interesting pop flavor/color. This bland, inoffensive approach is uninvolving, hence pointless.",0

"History, Erudition, Perspective, and Caution -- A Good Read

This author highlights important current issues (not just the squandering of our financial and natural resources) in the context of world history, explaing how we got to where we are; however, the author seems so determined to convince the reader that the sky is falling (and he may be right), that he exhibits occasional bias (in this reader's opinion) against some possible alternatives that might in fact give the human race a better chance. Maybe, I am simply too hopeful, and the author has a better understanding of human nature, world politics, and our technological limitations. Even so, this erudite and sobering book deserves careful reading and urgent public debate. Finally, please don't allow the author's several instances of incorrect use of mathematical ratios to distract you from his overall message.",1

"Stunning photography, enjoyable text, experienced advice!

EXPLORE MOUNT KILIMANJARO is an incredible book! It is packed full of information that is essential not only for the hiker, but also for the historian, naturalist, geologist, and even the social critic (the author concedes that though the indigenous Tanzanian porters who work the trails aren't paid much, they still make more money than most people in Tanzania; tipping generously is encouraged). And with at least one vivid color picture on every page (sometimes two or three) EXPLORE MOUNT KILIMANJARO may be the next best thing to actually being visiting this natural wonder.What I really enjoyed the most about this book was Jacquetta Magarry's writing style, which is information-packed, candid, and yet succinct.

I must preface this by saying that I have been an avid fan of B.O'Cult since 1979. I've seen them perform live three times. I love their music and the mystique. If I had purchased this on VHS I would have thought the numerous audio problems were a manufacturing flaw. There is no reason for this to be released on DVD. Or VHS.

By the way, anybody out there know where I can get a copy of the ""Black and Blue"" tour film?",0
"RIP Paul Klebnikov

I'm afraid folks are going a little overboard in rewriting history to celebrate a murdered friend or colleague.

Even more alarmingly this book seems to have been written by someone trying to emulate traditional prejudices the White Russian aristocracy that he so much wanted to join. Amongst the ex-pat circle in Moscow, Klebnikov's embarrasing anti-Jewish outbursts earned him the moniker ""Progrom Paul.""Although noone really should have taken this writer too seriously, someone out there apparantly did, and that's the tragedy of this story.

Don't expect Connelly's Blood Work in this movie. The story starts out nearly word for word from Connelly's book, however the Eastwood McCaleb is probably a good 30 years older than Connelly's McCaleb - what a disappointment. I cringed every time I saw Eastwood run or fire a gun. At one point in the movie, McCaleb and cop Winston recklessly blast out all of the windows of a speeding car for no apparent reason and then act as if nothing happened. Huh? Somewhere along the line, the movie diverges drastically from the book to the point where the real murderer turns out to be a completely different character. Too bad so much of the original book was lost in translation.",0

"4 1/2 stars

Joss Stone - The Soul Sessions (S-Curve, 2003)Yeah, she's 16, she's white, and she's from England, but she also got soul. This album is a near-classic, full of respectable remakes. Not many people can remake ""All the King's Horses"" by Aretha Franklin but Joss did a good job. And the way she flipped ""For the Love of You"" was awesome (note how she added in there, ""All we need is candlelights/And a D'ANGELO song""; game recognize game).However, Ms. Stone does a lot of screamin'. Dang girl, just sing the song!! This album reminds me of Monica's first album, Miss Thang, where Monica was doing so many vocal gymnastics, thus trying so hard to show us that although she was young, she can still sing. Then her second album, The Boy Is Mine, followed and she had a more mellow sound. Hopefully Joss's voice will mature the same way with her next release. -EJR",1

Gideon Defoe's portrayal of pirates that are looking for adventure and like to help people is ridiculously--well, PI-RADICAL!

I am a film major and I sometimes have to carry my G-Tech hard drive with me. The only problem is I needed a bag with padding, and the ability to store my connectors and power cord. I was shopping in Target and came across this bag. It has a compartment for you USB/Firewire and other cords. You also have some space for the power cord (but you may have to separate it). The bonus is the belt secures the hard drive itself and the luxury of having a handle strap.

Who would want to kill Penny Varnavides, especially in the exact manner portrayed in her forthcoming novel? Meredith, as Penny's ex-girlfriend, along with Penny's literary agent and editor, were the only three people who new the unique murder method employed in Penny's unpublished book and apparently used in real life on Penny herself. Meredith calls upon Lindsay Gordon to extricate her from suspicion in the glamorous world of London publishing. While encountering publishing industry notables, Lindsay turns up an unsavory mixture of soured relationships, underhanded fraud, and seething rivalries.

Bell hooks's book is an excellent introduction to the study of feminist politics. With clear and concise language, she revisits the beginnings of the movement, and tells us where it is now. She also succintly explains why feminism is not anti-male, anti-sex, or anti-family, but rather feminism is the struggle against rigid sexism in patriarchal cultures.

I got this even though some of the comments mentioned problems and leaking because I really wanted a no-fuss, stovetop cappuccino maker. And don't we all think it'll work for US? I've tried to make coffee/cappuccino using it 7 times and it's been a disaster. The leaking has nothing to do with the two halves being put together improperly, or cleaning the coffee grounds off the edges of the filter, or anything else obvious. It has to do with the aerator valve. If it's not put in place just exactly correctly, coffee does not bubble up into the pot at all, so the water has no where to go but onto your stove. Honestly, I've put the aerator on and off dozens of times - sometimes the pot worked, sometimes it did not. The difference between the two is impenetrable. Be warned, while it may work for some, it's extremely fussy and not at all worth the money.",0
"Bad Directing, what else can I say

What do you get when you have great actors and a promising story. Nothing when you combine it with an awful director. This movie is so horrible that it is more enjoyable to make fun of it then watch it.Main plot ideas are seeminly put in in random order. One of the main mysteries of the whole movie turns out to only come into play for about 2 minutes, and getting to the scene seemed impossible so they have the character waiting around for something to happen. The only one action scene in the movie takes about 5 minutes in all, and all is done with no sound at all except some grunting and the occasional thump. The movie works on character development throughout the movie, only to have nothing to do with it later on.Maybe this was a hurried film, or low budget, but even so, its bad for that. The story looks as if everything was just thrown in. Dumb and Dumber had a better story. Save yourself the money and buy a movie worth seeing.",0
"A Pleasure

Reading Ross MacDonald is a voyage into the past. His work is evocative of bygone eras and landscapes, and even on initial publication there was something decidedly old-fashioned about the attitudes, manners, the morals, the entire approach to detective fiction. Nearly twenty years after his death, a lot of readers are going to find him so dated as to be inaccessible. So, also, are Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammet, Arthur Conan Doyle and yes, Jane Austen, another old-fashioned writer of novels of manners.The Chill isn't an action-packed thriller, it isn't laden with pyrotechnics, it doesn't feature dashing heroes saving the world, and Archer most definitely is not going to get the beautiful girl in the end. So what?Reading this this book is more like savoring fine wine from an old bottle. Enjoy the flavors of the past, the convergence of themes and the complexity to the last drop.",1

This is a funny, yet sad story of a kind loss that many kids must face at a young age when they are just making friends for the first time. It is a best seller on the local bookmobile. It has about 200 words.",1
"Hand Painted Parasol: Beautifully Delicate

I bought this and one other parasol with the intention of using it as props during photo shoots. It is VERY beautiful but also very delicate. The parasol seems to be handmade and hand-painted. The parasol is made of thin material sewn with green string in and around the wooden frame. The parasol can close pretty well and comes with a nice ""sheath"" to put it in (unfortunately, I have misplaced mine). When opening the parasol all the way to the ""clicking point"", it does feel as if it's about to reach its limit. Push it all the way though, it's supposed to go that far (almost to a complete right angle with the top portion and the handle.Conclusion: Though delicate, I have not had any problems with the parasol. As long as they are treated as they are fragile, you should have no problem either. The parasol is beautiful and looks completely hand made and hand painted, adding to the attraction of it. A purchase I would gladly repeat!",1
"Written for shock value and profit!

This book which is nothing more then sections of his book ""Holy Blood Holy Grail"" Baigent regurgitates his theory of the ""Jesus conspiracy"" The book is a work written not for scholarly pursuits but shock value. It is a work that was written for the money and nothing more. If he had some new insights to offer or critical analysis of text the book might have some value. In the end it has no redeeming value as the author appears to be clearly attempting to capitalize on the sensationalism of Da Vinci and the law suit he was in over the same.",0
"Don't waste your time or your money on this book!

This Grisham Christmas fairy tale was a big disappointment. The story of Nora and Luther Krank's (could he choose better names for his characters?) decision to ""skip Christmas"" was a slow read from beginning to end. Travel plans, nasty, controlling neighbors and a pollyanna ending was laughable. This book would never have been published in the first place had it not been written by Grisham. He should stick to the type of writing he does best. Christmas ""fairy tales"" are NOT Grisham's strength!",0

When I first got this game I thought that you would actually be able to create your own hotel. (Inside and out!) But all you get to do is build the rooms, but not the outside. When you are finished, you have to wait about 5 minutes untill just 1 person comes! No matter how appealing your hotel might look to you, only about 10 people (max.) will come. It's not worth it!

"Jews Fight Too, a mid-20th century youth book

I read this book, from my Hebrew school's library, in the early 1960s. Written for teens, as I recall, it details achievements of Jews, as fighters. I particularly remember stories of Jewish American soldiers. It's been a long time, but I remember enjoying the writing.Since the book was written shortly after World War II and the Israeli War for Independence, the concept of Jewish fighters was still novel. I believe that the writer intended it as an antidote, to the idea that all Jews were helpless victims.In the 50+ years, since the book was written, Israeli fighting prowess has been proven, over and over. However, these older stories are still interesting.",1
"Really awful

After reading good reviews for this movie, I was expecting a good, offbeat movie with Jeff Goldblum and Parker Posie. I was really disappointed. The acting is horrible and the movie is hilarious in a cheesy bad way. The characters are unbelieveable (Jeff Goldblum trying to be a straight G-man) and one fails to feel any attachment to any of them. The action sequences are laughably bad and the score is distractingly low budget - I'm not sure if they were supposed to be funny (?). The ending is abrupt and disappointing. One of the worst produced movies I've seen in awhile.",0

"Great for the younger set, those learning their letters

We've enjoyed all the books in the Click, Clack series with our older son, so when I saw this one, I was curious. Unlike the delightfully amusing story books, Click, Clack Quackity-Quack is a basic concept book comprised of a sturdy board book and an attached ""keyboard."" Kids can push the letters on the keyboard, and each one creates a unique sound that (usually) ties in with the matching page in the book. The book contains a simple story that leads children through the alphabet.I think this book is fantastic for toddlers or young preschoolers who are just learning the alphabet or who are obsessed with letters, like my 2-year-old is. The story is basic and is centered more around letters and their sounds than around any major plot, but that's okay with the little ones. They'll have fun pushing buttons and hearing the noises...and learning along the way.",1

"Miracle!

Never thought I'd find an acne lotion that can also act as a legit concealer, but here this is. No only did this dried up the hard painful bumps in the area between my lower lip and chin, but it also meanwhile concealed the redness beautifully. I couldn't tell the difference between this and other brands like L'Oreal because it does such a nice job. And what more? Unlike other concealers, not only do you not have to take if off at night when you sleep, it is encouraged for you to apply it often! While not a qualm with me, I can see other people being turned off by the sulfur smell, but I guarantee you you'll be used to it soon enough, and might even enjoy it somewhat. Excellent product, one of the best acne treatment I've ever bought. 10/10",1
"I liked it

This game was a good time. It's definitely an adult game, and best played in a spirit of mean fun. Cries of ""Take one to the peppermint, Bitey!"" and ""Oh, no- not my tasty little legs!"" accompany gameplay. It's a pretty amusing parody of Candyland, a game which (while we may remember it fondly from our youths) sucked. The basic game play is similar to the original, but the addition of ""treat"" cards (which give you special powers) and the ability to attack other players change it from a game entirely based on chance to a game with an element of strategy.Gameplay is okay, though not inspired. This is a game you play for the fun of the situation, not for the brilliance of the game play.",1

"No man should buy Everyman

This is by far the worst film I have viewed in a long time. It appears to be an independent student production shot very badly on digital cameras...home cameras. The editing is bad, with repetitious shots (like in a cartoon) and the picture cuts out at one point and cuts back into the next scene with Good Deeds, and from that point on, the sound does not match up to the action/speaking. The director's choices are just odd, along with many of the costume choices as well. The acting is not particularly good, and it is only updated in setting...the dialogue remains true to an early translation. The two contrast badly. I don't doubt they all worked hard on this production, but sadly, the result is definitely not worth the money...or time to attempt to view it...unless you want a good example of bad film making.",0

"Not your classic Sebago loafer

I purchased in succession several pairs of the Sebago loafer back in the 1980s and 1990s. The shoes were then made in the US, as I recall. Each pair fit properly and took only a few days to break in. The leather was sturdy and good for several re-sole jobs. The finish was gorgeous with some of the leather's grain showing through, giving much depth to the finish.Today, the shoes are made overseas. The opening to insert your foot is now shorter and the shoe will no longer accommodate my high arch. The finish looks more like paint than polish. I can't comment on the quality of the leather or the soles, for I couldn't get my foot inside to wear them. A few years ago I wore a similar Sebago model (the Sherman) which had a rubber instead of a leather sole; the leather uppers on these failed after about 1 year.Classic?, I don't think so.",0

It's the same old song and dance. The left-wing revolutionaries fighting against the right-wing Nazis. Leninist/Marxists versus concentration camps.

If you want to know who is evil I can tell you ahead of time they have blue eyes (sometimes ""piercing blue eyes"") and/or blond hair. If you want to know who is good, just check their skin color. If they are non-white then they're fighting for justice and freedom. This is not to say that we should be rooting for whites over blacks. I don't mean that.

I have an axe and a hatchet, decades old, which have been struck into the dirt many times and which have spent many minutes on a grinding wheel. This sharpener didn't even touch the point, and only demonstrated how poor an edge I ground out. So, worked beautifully for my Gerber and Fiskers axes.The grinding wheel inside is just a stone cylinder with a V groove in it, held at an angle to the edge. Run the edge lightly back and forth through the V slot, and it's the rotation of the stone that sharpens little arcs into the edge. This doesn't need any down force.

Owned one of these several years ago, and the quality has gone down drastically on the newer models. The wood is more flimsy. Can't lock the width in place. Bought one of these recently and tried to tighten it snugly in a doorway, and the wooden lever snapped in two. I had to throw it away the same day I received it. Cheap plastic grate. If you have base boards, this won't fit because the width between the base boards is different than the width between the walls higher up. Also, everytime you take the gate down, you lose the place of the width you had selected. If you don't want to go to the hassle of taking the gate down, you have to climb over it, and that becomes a pain.

I started this book with a sense of foreboding, the back cover review saw to that. In its early stages, Something Dangerous (aka ""The Wishing Game"" in Britain) is excellent. The actions of Rokeby towards his teachers and his class mates leave you feeling a little dubious. Would a 14-year-old actually ever act like that? You get over it and assume he would, but just as you get to the really good scenes, the author resorts to the use of infuriatingly wrong punctuation (! or ! ) and UPPER CASE FOR SHOUTING. It is all so disappointing. The reader is clever enough to spot a shout if the author is up to conveying it. I do not think Mr. Redmond is and there the novel falls apart. There are just a few things wrong with this novel, but they destroy the atmosphere of the story. You want to get immersed in the words but are constantly being put off by the delibrate basic English errors. A shame",0

I recently attempted to upgrade from the Zire to the Palm TX. The organizer seemed fine at first. All went well for one week until the weird application looping started ( where it goes from one application to the other when you attempt to reach the desktop). Resets did not help and Palm tech support was able to solve the problem temporarily. I finally gave up and shipped it back to retailer. I would not rely on this machine with my important contact info.",0

"Entertaining Fluff

Noir: Vol. 3 - The Firing Chamber contains three episodes of the series about two female assassins, Mirielle and Kirika, known as ""Noir."" Noir has an international reputation that sends chills down the spine of the most hardened and wicked men.In this volume, we finally meet the mysterious girl who has been lurking in the shadows of the previous two volumes. Her name is Chloe, and she calls herself ""the true Noir."" Who is the true Noir?This DVD is a good way to while away an hour or so, but there are much better anime series out there. Noir is eye candy with little substance. I am tired of the ruthless women knocking off old men, young men, leaving children and pets orphaned. I cannot believe that fluff like this lasts for seven volumes, the same as the magnificent Escaflowne.One bonus on this DVD is an interview with the Japanese voice actress who plays Kirika. The interview is very good.",0

Based upon reviews here and at Bed Bath & Beyond, I took the plunge and purchased this item.I have not been disappointed!The heavy base keeps the unit in place.

The complaint is that only one side works, So there is no advantage to this part, I can only run one thing at a time. I need to have my computer and my printer both plugged in at the same time. Dont Buy This Part. I really like Amazon, I dont like this part. IT DOESNT WORK. BUY ANOTHER BRAND.Steve.",0
"Great Surprise

I bought this book at the airport for a plane ride to Tokyo thinking it would just be a trashy Hollywood book I could read to make the 17 hour flight go fast. I had never heard of Joe Eszterhas. Wow! This book was incredible. The vivid descriptions of his childhood intertwined with the inside world of the movie industry. I found myself actually not caring at all about the dish on the actors, I was more captivated by the strange ways all the deals are made to get from idea, to script to movie. Eszterhas is such a brilliant writer, I could feel, taste, and smell the Lorain Ohio he grew up in. I was so engrossed in this book I passed up 3 of the 6 meals they served on the plane!!!",1

As a joke, the founders of the Indiana State Constitution allowed any person of ""good morals"" be allowed to practice law in the state. Further, the amendment process is a long and troubled one, so it took the lawyers over 20 years to put standards of competency to practice law. William McLauchlan, a great professor who I studied under, provides an interesting insight to the Indiana State Constitution and recommend this book to anyone interested in law in Indiana.",1
"Great machine for the first couple months

My wife and I first started using this to drown out the general noise in our apartment. It worked great!! So well that when is started ""shorting out"", we didn't even notice we were fiddling with it every night. After about eight months, it just stopped working completely and nothing we did could turn the machine on. We ended up buying a replacement and even a second one for our daughter's room. Even after we bought our house, we still used both machines every night. Unfortunately, they both have started shorting out and are getting harder and harder to get working. For as much as I like the product, I'm faced with either replacing both units or replacing them with something else. I can't justify spending money on something that is only going to last a year at best.I would recommend this product if you were looking for something that will do the job, but only needed it for a couple months. Beyond that, you may or may not be able to get it to work longer.",0

"practical, functional lamp

No need to go into great detail here, as the other reviewers have managed to describe this item adequately. My experience with this lantern can be described thusly: it's about the size of a can of beer, is lightweight, casts enough light to read by, and it doesn't feel like it will fall apart at the first stiff gust of wind it encounters. It definitely will not survive being immersed in water. The reflector is pretty much a joke. If you live in hurricane country or in any other place that could conceivably be subject to long power outages, then a low-output LED lamp like this one, with its absurdly long battery life, can provide a safe substitute for candles.EDIT: It took two years to wear out the first set of batteries, and I've found that the switch is not entirely reliable (fails every fourth or fifth time its turned on.)",1

Harold and Kumar is well...it's pretty much a ""stoner"" movie as what most people call it. I will admit I had such a great time watching this film especially the gross out humor in near the middle of the film. I'll make this short and sweet.This isn't a bad film at all. It was pretty funny, Hell it's better then most of the crap that's come out inawhile!I enjoyed the film, had lots of laughs in theater and I recomend you watch this film. It ranks up with all those other ""stoner"" films likeHalf BakedCheech and Chong Up in smokeHow High(I think that is one)It's great to see that the guy who plays harold has better role as well..he is one of the main characters..duhh. He was always ""that asian guy"" in American Pie.

"i tried soooo hard......

Miss Stevie Nicks is my absolute favorite singer/songwriter of all time. I got this cd about a year ago and based on extremely mixed reviews i decided to give this a chance and not be influenced by the other reviews good or bad. That being said this cd is awful. i will always love Blue Denim but this cd has a generic jazzy/soft contemporary rock feel of the mid 90's. Its a shame because production killed this cd but ill admit some of the lyrics are pretty good. Destiny in particular since it has the same first verse as the timeless song ""Enchanted"" I adore anything that Stevie is involved in but this doesnt really even seem like it is her music, no wonder she didnt promote it and pretends now like it never happened, if she would have been able to be around for the producing of this album it could have been great, no fault to Stevie tho it fell into the wrong, greedy hands of someone trying to make money off her when she was getting her life on track!

This cute comedy is not a family film, although some of the adult humor would go over the head of a young child. The friendship and chemistry between the two male characters is refreshing. A light and pleasant romance enhances the story development. Casting was appropriate featuring Christopher Walkin as a mobster with comic aspirations to develop a lofty vocabulary. Good music, colorful characters, interesting scenery, unexpected twists of the plot and cute animals all work together very well. The dialog has many funny lines, some of which are subtle. The plot is neither simplistic nor excessively complex. This movie is politically correct without trying to be which is delightful.",1
"very good product

I have been using this product for quiet some time, and it has been a very user friendly program. IT is very easy to load and begin using. The lessons can be set to your skill level and can also be modified to the user's tastes. For example: I prefer to have the software review new words often to make sure that I'm learning mastering all words associated with the particular skill level; so progression to new levels is very slow. Furthermore, the software can be set according to the user's typing skill level (i.e the software can be set so that only a few letters need be typed, or evey letter has to be typed.)Additionally, the software has keeps track of how well the user is doing and can be set to display a chart of the user's progress. Word pronunciations are clear and precise and the graphical displays are also good.All in all, a very good product to use.",1

These are great knives, especially for the price. They are just like the Pro-S line from Henckels only are not hardened the same way. They are sharp.

I can't believe I used dull knives for some many years when these wonderful and affordable knives were so accessible. Definitely worth their weight in gold.",1
"Possibly the worst SF book every written!

While I firmly agree that one must suspend disbelief when reading SF, I refuse to suspend all rational thought. In order to read Pavlou's book, be prepared to throw out all knowledge of the way the world works.For example, he seems to be under the impression that US Navy ships are manned by marines, not sailors.He doesn't understand that the Navy doesn't randomly name ships within a class.He thinks that pulsars are the same thing as variable stars, instead of rapidly rotating neutron stars.He's apparently never heard of plate tectonics.His knowledge of geology, biology, linguistics, and symbology matches his knowledge of astronomy.The only think that kept me reading this book was a sick facination with how terribly bad it was.

"works great to stop barking, when collar actually works

This collar works great to stop unwanted barking without harming your dog, however I have been through two of these collars in justa few months because the collars themselves are unreliable. The first one sprayed once, then stopped working. Amazon was great and sent a replacement even though I couldn't send the defective one back (the pressurized spray is classified as hazardous). The second one worked well for a few months but then just stopped spraying no matter what I did-refilled reservoir, changed battery. The spray started leaking out slowly. I give up, I'm not even going to bother calling Amazon for yet another one, but I might go to my local pet store to get one (different brand maybe!!) so that I can deal with a local store if I have this kind of problem again, but when the collar did work, the effect on my dog was immediate!",0

His lyrics are only there to make the beats go along with something, and his joke songs aren't funny. His tribute songs make you wonder if he has any grasp of the inspiration behind the artists he loves. After ""The United States of Whatever"", which is song 2, it all goes downhill.

The songs have most of the right elements but don't seem like much effort was put into making them sound as good as they could.

For example, in p.31, the definition of xPy does not work as it is not able to account for 0P305. The definition should be corrected as:xPy iff There is z not greater than y (zBy and xEz). Similar mistakes can be found elsewhere. And this book thus requires another edition for the coorection of typos and mistakes.",1
"response to 3 m littmann stethoscope

I don't ""hate"" the product because I cannot make a judgement on it since I have yet to receive the product. I chose the 1 star rating because it was the lowest rating available. I do, however, intensely dislike the amazon service as relates to this product.This is the 2nd survey you have asked me to complete, and still the ordered item has not arrived, despite an e-mail claiming a ship date of 12/23/12. It is now more than a month after I ordered what I thought would be a Christmas gift. Amazon should definitely follow up with this vendor.kcm",0

The book started so slow and confusing (for book 1 of a series, not good) I put it down but eventually picked it back up and I'm glad I did.

"One of the worst

I think I have read almost every book about football written, and I was excited to find a read about my favourite conference. Before I reached the third chapter, I knew I would be dissapointed..... I have never seen someone butcher a topic of such interest to me. Say what you like about Fienstein, but at least he can string two sentances together. Save your money and buy A Civil War. It ten times better.",0

WOW. These stories are riveting and imaginative and each one is a gem. It brings to mind the examined life. There's a wistful, sadness in each, much as most of us would feel when we examine our own lives.If you are a fan of the short story, this selection is powerful good stuff.",1
"Didn't work for me

I was very anxious to try this product after reading all the reviews. I've never left a review before, but figured I should with this product. I bought the pills mainly for an energy boost. Once my pills came, I couldn't wait to try them out. So that morning I took 2 on an empty stomach, thinking that they would give me some energy. Well they didn't,in about 2 hours I was very drained and fatigued. So I figured maybe because I didn't get much sleep the night before, that was the reason the pills didn't work. Over several weeks I continued to use them hoping that once they got into my bloodstream I would see results. Well it never happened. I finally had to face the fact, that these pills just didn't work for me, like they did for everyone else. So now I'm back to the drawing board on finding some type of energy booster for myself. If you decided to try this product, I hope your results are better than mine.",0

"dissapointed in quality & design

We got this diaper bag so both my husband and I could use it. I thought it would be durable and easy to use. Within 3 months the pad on the shoulder strap had come off. One of the straps that held it on the shoulder strap got shredded by rubbing against the clasp on the side. Also, I don't like the feature of the 2 handles at the top of the bag getting velcroed together. When rushing to get something in the bag it is more challenging to get to the zipper and contents of the bag when you have to separate the velcroed handles. With a crying baby response time is critical.To be fair, I have to state the positive. It does not look like a diaper bag so it can pass as a briefcase and Dad won't lose his manliness carrying it. Also, the fold out changing pad is very convenient to use especially with the bathroom fold down changing tables.",0

This is one of my favorite Merton books. It's a journal on the way to his ordination as a Trappist. Merton admits some questions about his discernment.

"Long but very good

If you have the time, there was an illness in the family and I needed to relax from daily chores this is an excellent read. The book is so much more than the story of Anna Karenina, although that is the most famous portion. And that is a good story. But I found the young man''s struggles with being a land owner and the new laws that freed the serfs very interesting. The philosophical discussions between what would become the members of communism and the old aristocrats. The struggles to be fair and difiiculties with a new portion of society, all were very interesting and a large part of Tolstoy's novel.",1

"It's Skincare Heaven!

The Japanese are world renowned for their fantastic near perfect skin! But it's still surprising to have a product deliver exactly what it offers. Each pack is recommended to be used 3 times, but I got 5 uses out of some.Just applying some of this powder to my skin and massaging it in then rinsing has left me with a great skin tone and a lot less blemishes for the month or less I've been using it. Buy this! As someone who's tried a lot of products, take my word and buy this! I'm guessing the rice powder this cleanser consists of is magic in a pack.One bad thing is that if you wet the actual package the powder is in you'll get screwed. My only complaint is the kind of annoying packaging, however it does come in useful when traveling.You could just open all the cleanser packaging (30) and put them in a class, tall, tube, similar to a salt and pepper shaker and then use that instead.",1

A friend chose this for our book club selection and although I really wanted to just abandon it, I did end up finishing it. I didn't find the story line to be super interesting or compelling and I didn't care much about the characters who were, at times, difficult to keep straight. There is a lot of detail left vague and the ending is somewhat predictable. It wasn't so bad that I refused to read it but I did not enjoy it and would not recommend it others.",0

This is the true story of an ex-Polish army Officer, sent to a Siberian Labor Camp and escaped! He and 3 comrades escaped in the dead of winter during a blizzard (to cover their tracks and prevent being followed by dogs.)

"Ah! Jessica Walters - Beautiful but frghtening!

We decided to watch this movie after having listened to some music the other night at dinner. It was Johnny Mathis singing ""Misty"". It reminded me of the movie which I probably haven't seen since sometime in the 80s. It's not a perfect movie, but the suspense is well done. Paradoxically, there was some empathy evoked for the femme fatale - a perverted allure to her beauty and devotion. What is really frightening to me is not how she manifested her obsession but how real this kind of obsession is. My recommendation is watch the movie if you haven't yet and see it again if you have!",1
"This book would have been great even if you didn't know who wrote it

The fact that it is by Steve Martin is a distraction. In fact, the fact that it is written by a man is a distraction. This is a beautifully written portrait of a young woman, written with a lot of sympathy and wit. Some of the sentences are so well written it would send pangs of professional envy through the heart of any writer. The only thing I dislike about this book is that I know it is written by an older man who is quite rich, and the book is about a young woman falling for an older man who is quite rich, and that bit is really annoying as you wonder who Martin is fantasizing about. Take that bit out, though, it really is a very beautifully scripted tale and worth purchasing and reading.",1

The third unit didn't last a month when the hard drive crashed.

"Cool book!

I consider myself to be an avid reader and I like the books I read to be interesting and easy to read. I found that Hot Type by Tom Kacich is the best of both worlds for me - the stories come from Champaign and Urbana in Illinois but they could easily be from any town in this country. The stories in the book are compelling and the format of the book allows the reader to read a few stories at a time or the entire book at once. Mr. Kacich has done a fine job researching the stories and the photos are interesting, too. Hot Type is not just a book for people from Illinois but a must for all avid readers!",1

I had ingrown hairs (from epilation) and tried this product. I decided to put it on one leg only, to see if I could notice a difference. I applied it once or twice a day for about 2 weeks without noticing any difference between the treated leg and the untreated one. There was some minor improvement, but I concluded that it was due to the body's natural healing process, as the same amount of healing was visible in the leg where no solution was used.",0

You can't expect much from something this cheap. The repair kit cannot be use with this stick because it will chip the paint and make it look ugly.I know bars have really bad cue sticks.

This is a good collection of good Tull tunes, but not all-inclusive. Most disappointing for me is how chopped-down some of the tracks are (though there's not much other option with ""Thick as a Brick""). Instead, I might recommend the newer live release Living With the Past. (I have the DVD.)",0
"Things pretty much the same in John Irving's world

It is a competent, interesting book but not much more than that. After reading Hotel, Garp, Bears, and Meany; I have noticed they all tread similar ground. There is the mostly ineffectual narrator, there are the characters who thrive because of the quirks & fallacies not in spite of them, there are the same catchphrases repeated over and over, there is the continued fascination and reliance on Vienna as a plot device. Don't get me wrong, Hotel is an OK book. Some good observations are made like ""we pick up our Chipper Dove's only to put them back down again"" or Lilly's euphimism for writing. Irving also probably uses foreshadowing better than any other writer. But I felt after Garp & Bears, this is the 3rd time I have basically read the same story. Owen Meany diminutive frame still towers over the rest of Irving's works.",0

"Don't buy it!!!

I bought this router for the promises of distances of a quarter mile even though I just wanted it to connect straight out the window about 75 yards a way in another building. Not only in the end did the router not even go the distance, the installation was thoroughly disappointing and not even remotely up to par with other brands. Some parts of the manual don't work if you are using MAC, the auto run for the mac does not work, and once you get the instructions working, they are confusing, not detailed, and sequential. Then once you get it running the fan noise reminds of me my 1994, 486 computer. If you have a couple of hours to spend remembering the configuration old days where everything was manual, you don't mind that the range is no further than a normal router, you have over $250 to spend, and you don't want to hear the person on the phone because the fan is too loud then this router is for you.",0
"The worst Jack Higgings ever!!!

This has got to be the worst ever Higgins book. Though the author has hit past home runs (the Eagle has landed), this is a really terrible effort. He creates potentially interesting characters, only to kill them off with a sentence pages later. He sets up poitential conflicts (the leading bad guy is given Hitler's diary to safekeep) only to never make it a significant part of the plot--seems that all the Baron got was billions to spend on his own companies! He even sets up potential surprises (Dillon hiding a gun against the moment when the nasties surprise him) only for it never to be used. Higgins, I suspect, wrote this book only after a martini or two. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!",0

All classic stuff, this collection contains such great holiday memories as ""Christmas Time Is Here"" from A Charlie Brown Christmas, ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" from Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer, and ""You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" from How The Grinch Stole Christmas. This song is sung by the incomparable Thurl Ravenscroft, who, pretty much up until his death in 2004, remained active in a number of notable ways, including having his voice used for various public announcements heard throughout Disney World, and more importantly, providing the voice of Tony The Tiger in the Frosted Flakes commercials.",1
"Sexy Love Hate Relationship!

No need to reproduce plot so here's the skinny...this book is hot! Annalia is a bit sassy to say the least and Court MacCarrick is the sexy man/beast of a Scot. Basically she saves him, he's a little put out by that since he's a ""manly man"" and then they fight a great deal. She thinks he's hot but is repressing her sexuality because she basically thinks her mother left her as a child because of her ""passions"" for another man so she denies those feelings. Court is also denying his feelings because of some family curse which makes him think he's basically a death wish to Anna. The characters were so funny, they really reminded me of a husband and wife with the way they fought. Can't wait for Hugh's story! I'm ordering it for my library tomorrow!",1

I've read several of Cornwell's mysteries, and perhaps I've just picked the wrong ones. I'm so tired of hearing of the evil Carrie and what she did to poor Lucy and other recurring major characters. I've also lost interest long ago in the love life of just about every recurring character in this series. Furthermore, it's too bad the author can't present pathology without excessive gore. Please, Ms. Cornwell, come up with something new and ease up on your noble heroine's ongoing private problems (or at least change them a little). I really enjoy ME mysteries and would like to see something similar to the approach of ""Silent Witness"" or the latest J. Deaver books (minus the heavy gore).",0
"Insightful at times, but uneven in execution

I realize the authors are among the top thinkers in their field. Their brilliance shines through on page after page of this book. However, some chapters are too basic, while others are clearly watered down versions of seriously advanced academic writing, leaving the reader at times bewildered and at others aching for more depth. Of course, your own training may affect which is which.I recommend the book for anyone with a basic to intermediate marketing background, looking to flesh out his or her understanding of the practice. More advanced readers will find nuggets here and there, but mostly will cover familiar ground.

"Could have been so much more

Dissappointing is all I can say. Their influences are so right on and so worn on their sleeves that they COULD have made a real statement. A shameless nod to the Cars and to 80's synth pop plus a modern sensibility. Instead they hint at it with so much of a self-conciously ""home-made"" sound that it loses me by the third song. They obviously went with a producer by name value instead of with someone who realy undertood them and the result is, sad to say, generic.I still think they are a special band under all this; but this is not that special record they could have made. Recommended for only the faithful. If you saw them live and loved them, this will NOT take it to any new levels for you. And that's too bad.",0
"The Best of Pete, Don, Doug, Mark, John and Origin Records

I bought this disc soon after its release in '98. Two gorgeous tracks, one by Marc Seales, piano and the other by bassist Doug Miller bring me back again and again. The highlight of the disc IMHO is After Letting Go by Doug. The rhythm section trio is called ""New Stories"" and is terribly under-recorded. So good to see the entire Origin Records catalog available including some new artists. To the discs, each of Origins productions I have are beautifully recorded. This particular one is my fav of latter day Pete Christlieb. On soprano Don Lanphere shows great restraint and supple melody. The two weave their lines well. Definitely highly recommended.",1
"Not exactly new

The mug I ordered is awesome, it arrived very quickly and the cat does disappear which is cool. The problem is the mug package was taped shut with packing tape and looked like it was stuffed in someone's closet for a few years, and the mug handle has 3 chips in it where it is painted black, so the white chips are pretty noticeable. I expected new from the description stating it was new, so I was a little disappointed, but it arrived quickly and otherwise is in good condition.",1

"Best of the 80's --Are you Kidding?

At first glance, this compilation deserves a listen to. With rockers like Some Like it Hot, Switching to Glide and the infectious groove of Jeopardy it even appears rather intriguing.However, it is at that very moment when you realize this isn't what you thought is was! Switching to Glide is pared down to a whopping 2:22, which is only about the chorus of the song. Add to this that there are no other rockers here (the title is described as Rock) and the Cd fizzles. Pop-crap like Break My Stride, St. Elmo's Fire, and Love is a Rock, make this a CD of B-sides and wishful thinkers. Certainly not anything close to a ""Best of"" label. Maybe 10th or 11th best, but give us the FULL VERSIONS OF THE SONGS!",0

Jance has given Beaumont two, distinct cases to be solved and it's done cleanly and without confusion.

I would like the dialogue to have been a bit more crisp, but that's a small complaint. I've missed J.P. and am glad to see him back. If you've not read the series, definitely start with the first. If, as I am, you're a fan, you'll definitely enjoy this new entry.",1
"Oh, please

This is one of the most annoying books out there on anorexia. Yes, anorexia is an insidious illness, but Jenny Lauren comes across as a spoiled, privileged, ungrateful, whiney, name-dropping brat. It's really hard to care about her or empathize with her because of her unbelievable sense of entitlement and hypochondria. It's also hard not to be annoyed by her complaints about living in a world where she has access to anyone or anything -- doesn't she appreciate this on some level? I mean, c'mon. Ironically, her writing style is so cumbersome and cloying that if she weren't a member of the Ralph Lauren family, she'd never have been published.For a much more authentic, compassionate and well-written treatment of privileged youth and eating disorders, I'd recommend Lori Gottlieb's STICK FIGURE: A DIARY OF MY FORMER SELF.",0

"Elementary, it's great

I grew up watching these old B&W detective movies with my Dad.. he was a big fan. I was just a little girl, but had and still have a huge crush on Basil Rathbone.

Nobody else, can ever be SH or Dr. Watson in my mind, these two set the bar too high. I believe they made about 14 films in this series, and I've got about half of them on DVD. I can watch them over and over, they are classics. These two, are two of my fav. episodes. I esp. love the films that Dennis Hoey is in . He's such a lovable oaf. He's in both of these films.",1
"Even better in audio!!

Do you want to experience a bleak post-apocalyptic world? Listen to Rupert Degas's reading of Cormac McCarthy's The Road. McCarthy won a Pulitzer Prize with this novel describing the passage of father and son down an endless road in a wiped-out environment, scavenging for food to survive where they can. I read the novel first so I knew the story, but couldn't tear myself away from this audio. Degas (in totally different voice to his readings of another contemporary `great', the novels of Haruki Murakami) doesn't get emotionally embroiled...just reads it like it is. As listeners, we can only observe, frightened, hopeful, concerned, occasionally tearful, as father/son stagger on to an ending you know is coming in one way or another. McCarthy's language, spare and powerful, hits home like poetry. Required listening for politicians playing nuclear power games.",1

Sometimes the words are quite hard to see.The only disappointment came when the movie finished without the ending from the novel. If the original film was lost then it is forgivable. If not, I don't understand the deletion.Beware! The film is intended to be a true depiction of life in a slave state where no one can be trusted. Ayn Rand saw it and lived it herself.

The Cat in the Hat Comes Back is another story about the Cat inviting himself into the home of the two kids and (to their dismay) making a spectacular mess, but cleaning it up before their mother gets home. This time the mess is a pink cat stain that moves from the bathtub to other parts of the house and then outside into the snow. Naturally the Cat's efforts to clean it up keep making it worse, until the whole yard is a bright pink color.The story and illustrations are a lot of fun and have some brilliant ideas. For example, there are twenty-six little cats named ""A"" through ""Z"", each of whom comes out of the hat of the previous one to help with the mess. The dramatic solution to the problem is found in the hat of ""Little Cat Z who is too small to see"" (you'll have to be American for that rhyme to work). As a kid, I sure thought that was neat... in fact I still do.Dr. Seuss is talented at holding a kid's interest and this book is one of his best.",1

They used to be good, now I want ot vomit.Instead of this, buy their self titled album and 'Super Bigmuff plus Early Singles.' Those both hold up even with age.

None of my expectations of this product were met except that tells the time of day. I find it IMPOSSIBLE to get readings when I'm running unless I actually stop (and not even then all the time). GREAT, huh? Also, it is such an awkward motion to try to get a reading when I'm running because I have to reach over to the other side of my body, make sure the watch is at a low a position as possible and hold the buttons down for anywhere from 4 to 15 seconds. I haven't even been able to get a reading then. If you think that doesn't throw your running continuity and form off, try it sometime (particularly when you're trying to check your pulse when your racing). I'll probably eat the $100 I paid because of shipping (they said it was free shipping, but NOT IF YOU'RE SHIPPING IT BACK. THEY WIND UP CHARGING YOU FOR SHIPPING BOTH WAYS) and restocking costs. What's my humorous reaction, 'Mama MIO', but believe me I'm not happy. Don't bother buying this one.",0

HI - I wrote a review of this earlier this year - and I am still impressed by the fact you can send computer audio or any audio throughout your house...However, it looks like as of about May 1, 2004 the website that the hardware works with is no longer active. When you are deciding whether you want this, factor that into your decision. In my case, it's still good, but I can no longer control the channels. I have to set up some audio playing on the PC first and I can't change channels. Buyer beware.",0

"Does not pair well with Boulder phones

I bought eight of these units for our company. All eight have the same problem - people on the other end of the line hear themselves echo. This doesn't happen on every call - probably about 75 percent of the time. I have contacted BluAnt several times about the problem, but they have not been much help. They said that we could send the units back and they would send us new ones. What are the chances of all 8 devices being defective? They finally admitted that they have had many reports of these devices not pairing well with Boulder phones. Even the two blackberries that are used with them get the echo. Not quite as frequent as the boulder phones. I would not recommend this product to anybody. BluAnt customer service is not help either!",0

This album is filled with great rhythms and music, plus Alex Kaprano's voice is really good, something that really helps.

The video game quality FX is not laughable, its tear jerkable. If you want to challenge yourself, if you want to see how much stinko film you can tolerate, by all means buy this GARBAGE! Otherwise, get the Gene Barry version, watch the George Pal effects, and consider yourself lucky.",0
"Disappointing....

I had high expectations for this book: the reviews were great and it won the Booker Prize. I was disappointed. The book had only a few good moments. I admit that Roy did a good job with some descriptive passages. It wasn't enough to make this a good book. Throughout the story, all the characters remained unlikeable. While I understand that they were caught in a cultural web not of their making, none of the characters was able to break free. The literary devices employed by Roy served as a distraction rather than an enhancement of this story. Also, Roy's disjointed writing style was extremely annoying.",0
"Comprehensive Potty Book

This book is more comprehensive than some in that it not only covers the little girl in diapers and her potty training, but also her big girl panties and ""accidents"".

"Don't know Placebo? Buy this album and become a fan

'Every You, Every Me' was the first song I hear from Placebo, and I instantly love it, it's very catchy. Then I bought the album and after a couple of listenings, I felt in love with it.All the songs are great, but I love the title track 'Without you I'm nothing' which I think is a great, great song. I also like a lot 'Pure morning', 'The crawl', 'Summer's gone' and of course 'Every you, every me'.I think this is the best album to start listening to Placebo, and then get into it more deeply with the debut album, then 'Black Market Music' and finally 'Sleeping with ghosts' (whick I think is the worst Placebo album, although is a good one).Awesome album. Well deserved 5 stars.",1

As a lover of the suspense and thriller genre ""Man on a Ledge"" looked like a good Saturday, popcorn, late night movie. It was more of a Lifetime Movie Channel kind of show, very amature.

The skyscrapper scene, ""I'm gonna jump - here I go..."" crowd gasping...nevermind, just give a cigarette from the gorgeous, I-can-toss-my-hair New York negotiator played by Elizabeth Banks was comical.

It really helps, you can go look up words or simply use the back, which shows you how to say tiny phrases such as ""Help me"" ""I'm hungry"" ""I'm Hot"". The back also gives the consumer some cultural insight and history.My only problem with it, is that verbs are not displayed as either i-dot or i-dotless.verbs should be explained in more detail if you are going to do a section on them in the front, and most dishearting of all is that the top page markers are wrong. on some pages you will find the bolded word in the middle instead of at the end.However all things considered this is a great assest for anyone wanting to learn Igbo.",1

I spent 9 years in a monastary in the 60s, and left in 1969. Since then I have remained a Catholic and have read much on the subject of Church, and Church History, and on the present-day crises. Sorry, but Michael Rose did not hit on the right answer for a lack of vocations. He started with a conclusion and worked backwards. His conclusion is that orthodox (conservative) vocations are being turned away, and that the liberal institution is the one turning them away, and he uses some very flimsy criteria to prove it. One only has to look at the dioceses he cites as being low in vocations versus the ones that have higher perentage rates, and one can see that one of the critical variables is urban versus city, instead of orthodox versus liberal. This was just not good journalism. Sorry, the problem goes much deeper than that.",0

With almost offbeat patterns the drums set the pace for the entire CD, slowing it down to almost a complete stop sometime, just tpo build it back up to a choir of muscial talent.

I concur with the previous reviewer that this disc has definite sound quality problems. It sounds like the person who mastered it fell asleep at the controls. That aside, there are several gems on this disc including versions of classics like ""The Jug of Punch,"" ""Brennon on the Moore"" and ""The Moonshiner."" On the down side, most of these songs lack the spark of their live recordings. I was unenthusiastic about several songs performed by family members other than the four original lads (the exception being the lovely ""I'll Tell My Mar"" by Peg and Bobby Clancy).

I read a couple of the reviews that say it does, but from what I read, most of those reviewers still had young babies. Once your baby gets older, it does NOT control the odor anymore. I have two other friends with older babies that have the Champ and both agree, the Diaper Champ STINKS, both literally and figuratively! I would stick with the Diaper Genie.

"Didn'y initially work

Installed into Dell Optiplex GX150, originally had one 256Meg DIMM. Installed the PNY DIMM in the empty slot, and turned on computer - nothing happened, and it wouldn't boot. Removed PNY DIMM, and turned on computer, everything was fine. I then removed the DIMM that came with the Dell, and installed the PNY in that slot, and the original in the previously empty slot. Turned on computer, everything works fine now. Kinda weird, not sure why it behaved like that. Also, when in the second slot where it didn't work, noticed after I removed it that it was very warm on one side. Anyway, it works well now, but beware, it is fussy about which slot it goes into.",1

"A great design, but ""fragile""

I bought this product because I'm impressed with the feature it has, and as a customer support engineer I need the computer case that has a professional look at the customer place but should be comfortable enough to carry on the street. Most of the time I carry it as a backpack. But it's not tough as it should be. It last only 1 month and the inner side between the padded computer compartment began to tear. Because it has a lifetime warranty, I went back to the shop and got a new one. After a month plus the inner side (I will say it as a weakness) starting to tear again and then I will go back to the shop to replace it.",0

"another pathetic attempt from Necro

Boy, Necro once had so much potential. The beats on the first two Non-Phixion albums, his first two solo joints, and Ill Bill's album/mixtapes were insane. He was a great beatmaker and a passably decent emcee.But now he is running out of ideas and realizing that he isn't going to make it in the music industry. So rather than innovate, he puts out this violent steaming pile of refuse, a clumsy attempt to mix rock and hip-hop. Of course all the &*%#-riders are going to wax about how thugged out this music is, but in reality, Necro is just a depressed, self-loathing selfish dust-head with nothing to say. That was fine on his first two albums, but it's no longer funny or cute. It's pathetic.Psycho-Logical is a sinking ship...and the captain Necro is steering his team toward the iceberg. Ill Bill should jump before he drowns with the rest of the jokers on this label.",0

"Review: America Goes To War

Charles Patrick Neimeyer's ""America Goes To War"" was a well researched, documented, and written book. Neimeyer explains who served in the Continental Army, the reasons they served and the difficult lives the soldiers had. The text is annotated throughout with supporting evidence and an extensive bibliography gives the reader several sources for further study.However Neimeyer's conclusions do have a leftest bias that caused this reader to question several of the interpretations of the information presented. Also very little of the warfare between the British and American armies was explored in this book and the affect it would have on the social history of the American Army.Over all this is a good book to understand the men who served in the Continental Army and some of the reasons why.",1

The book also serves as a great way to teach the law and ethics of journalism through example.",1

"an entertaining new series

I came across this book by accident, just looking for a new book to read and this came up as a recommendation. I'm so glad I took that chance and ordered it. Shanna Whelan is a dentist who has a little problem, she's afraid of blood. She hasn't always suffered from this problem, but it's a result of a deadly shooting she witnessed. Roman Draganesti is a vampire who needs a dentist. His fang has fallen out and he needs it put back before he heals. He winds up on her doorstep, and thinks he can ""mojo"" her into fixing it and that will be it. Problem is she can resist his ""mojo"" and has the Russian mob after her. This tale has many twists and turns, a few surprises and finally a herione that isn't helpless. She takes matters into her own hands, and doesn't fall right into his arms. It's a very entertaining read, and you'll be happy you picked this up. I'm looking forward to her future books.",1

I have read all of Colin Harrison's books, and had eagerly awaited this one. Although the pace is just as driving and the characters as interesting, the violence - expecially the scenes with the drill - seemed gratuitous to me. I know Harrison is drawn to the dark underbelly of society, but in the past any violence or kinky sex was tied to character development. Here Harrison seems intent on providing grisly scenes of torture simply for shock value. As another reader suggested, you would do well to read ""Bodies Electric"" and ""Manhattan Nocturne"" before this book.",1

The redesign of the head set, they have added these fake leather bits around the ears and these HUGE HUGE ear covers that did nothing but make my ears sweat (I didn't realize my ears sweated before I had these God-awful headphones on) and in general they screwed up a really good product. I really do not reccomend them, except perhaps as torture devices.",0

These are pieces that require a very introspective interpretation, particularly the Ravel & the Fouré. To me, these performances are too precise & stiff.

That said, it's all a matter of taste.",0
"Brilliant and Ingenious collaboration

Of all the Ravi Shankar's 'fusion' compositions in the sixties, seventies and some more later, this one stands apart from the others. First of all, performances are of highest class as usual. One cannot imagine a better quality. Regardless of difference of grammar and notation, the final product from, as they say it, east and west, overwhelms the listener. The mood is more oriental here, at least in my opinion. Virtuoso performances by Menuhin makes that impression more stronger. However, this one actually combines the musical conception of the two parts of the globe better than other 'fusion' works.If you are in the West and are interested in Indian music, this can be an outstanding start. Same goes for Indian listeners who are not familiar with western concert music. Within the complex web of Violin, Sitar and orchestra, the good melodies are always there to enjoy and relish.",1

James W. Loewen, one of the last of the leftist jedi knights, is having difficulties dealing with the reality of history as it is tought toi America's youth. He and his borderline socialist proclivities try to decry any of the myth and magic pertaining to America's past. He attempts to humble our founding fathers while glorifying the historical unknowns simply because their meaningless lives are not dignified by a three day weekend as they would have turn 300 years old. Regardless of Leowen's so-called statistics (he warns us to never believe any statistics), and an endorsement by the only other historian who still claims Kennedy was killed by the military-industrial-complex -- Howard Zinn, his book is without focus or cohesive point of view.

"Not her finest effort

Coincidentally, I read ANGEL FALLS consecutively with Barbara Delinsky's COAST ROAD, so maybe it wasn't a fair contrast, but both novels deal with virtually identical themes, a wife/mother who lies unconscious in a hospital. How the women get to the hospital differ, yet that's just a detail; the exploration of the impact of the enormity of their illnesses on their families, and the uncertainty as to whether each woman will survive, are absolutely the same. Delinsky's characters were far more believable and sympathetic--even, in the case of COAST ROAD, the self-absorbed ex-husband. Her characters evolved in response to their crisis. Again in contrast, the most intriguing plot point in ANGEL FALLS, the hidden first marriage of the heroine, could have, should have, been explored with far more information and interest. Fans of Kristin Hannah may be disappointed in this eagerly awaited novel.",0

This book has some great material, and its history bits are good, but if you just want some hints on learning to dance there is way too much 'stuff' you have to wade through before you get to anything about dancing ... you're half way through the book before you get to the actual dance steps - and too much stuff you have to wade through around each dance.If you want LOTS of history and detail, this is the book for you. If you want to get down to dancing ... it has some good info in it, but it takes a lot of work to find it",0
"terrible horrible and little action

I enjoy action movies and have liked Jet Li and Jason Statham in movies in the past, but this was terrible acting and not enough good action to make up for it. We got this as a treat for our teenage son who'd just gotten off of a grounding, and we feel that we did him an injustice by having this be the first movie he'd seen in two months. It was bad enough that the acting was terrible and the plot predictable and stupid, but the cookie cutter shootout, car chase, cycle chase and, considering the abilities of two of the stars, boring and too-few fight scenes made this one of my least favorite movies of all time. We apologized to our son for having this be the first movie that he'd watched in two months. Don't even think of renting this, never mind buying it, unless you have a grudge against someone and are getting it for them.",0
"Academic's Imperfect Idea of the Market

This book on credit derivatives models is written by an academic without a feel for how the market trades in practice. Schonbucher presents the mathematical equations without expanding on the meaning of the models or their application.There are some errors of fact when he discusses how certain products work, such as first-to-default baskets, a serious error in and of itself, but unfortunately there are additional similar errors which show the author has an imperfect understanding of the market he writes about. All in all this book was an unsatisfying treatment of the topic.",0

"Excellent Optical Mouse, but lacks features of prior version

I have used many different versions of Microsoft's wireless and wired optical mice. Their most recent addition to the pointing device family is excellent with the notable exception of the back and forward buttons generally found on higher end mice.

The wireless functionality works flawlessly through its USB connection and the mouse fits nicely in an average sized hand.",1
"WHOLE TRAIN REVIEW

WHOLE TRAIN has a trailer that was first seen by me at tribalgear.com and when i saw it i knew i had to see what was poppin'. The movie is GERMANY'S beat street, wild style, and style wars rolled into one for a new generation and it amazes me that there is such a movie that was made as rugged and real as possible. The movie was everything that i could have expected and kept me glued to my seat. I don't speak German and the subtitles were no problem for me to read during such a real movie. This is a must for you real hip hop heads out there wanting to see a movie that makes you feel the same as any old school hip hop motion picture ever made. PEACE, hope you enjoy the film.",1
"Book Lacked Focus

This book lacked a lot of focus in what it wanted to accomplish. Was it trying to give tips on how to win at Monopoly or trying to show how the game teaches lessons to be applied to real life? In both cases, it came up lacking. The tips it gave were rather common-sensical, the stories it shared didn't really give any insight into how the game applies to business, and to top it off, it didn't not give accurate rules to the game. For example, the book said that you couldn't collect rent while in jail, so you should always try to stay out of jail and in the game, just like in life. That's a nice maxim to live by, but you CAN collect rent while in jail and every good business person knows that there are times to be aggressive and times to be conservative. Overall, the book was very disappointing and I hope only to spare others from making the same mistake of wasting time reading it.",0
"bad purchase

I bought this pump and used it about 8 hours per day in my pond for four weeks. Went out one morning and found the pump wasn't working, I checked the gfi and found it had blown. I tried to reset it and it wouldn reset. I unpluged the pump and then could reset it. Thinking my gfi might be old I pluged the pump in direct to see if it would run the motor humed but wouldn't run. The motor has shot. I checked it with a volt ohm meter and found the motor was bleeding to ground. So $150.00 bucks plus shipping down the drain. Mine could be an exception and it did work well for the four weeks but wouldn't by another one.",0

"Average Niven - meaning it's better than most

It's good to see a new world by Niven, but this one seemed incomplete somehow. I had trouble with some of the plot ideas, especially the lack of adventurism of the citizens of Spiral Town, the descendants of interstellar explorers. The ending seemed to be set up for a sequel but it also seems too flat to be good. Perhaps a prequel is in order. Niven has done better, but he has done worse. Definately worth reading despite the flaws.",1

I never heard from them again.It surely could have gotten lost in the mail. I never received it and they did not want to hear me out about the problem..",0
"good

Undertow is, overall, a good album. Although I'm probably in the minority on this one, I think ""Bottom"" and ""4"" stand out on this album, followed up by ""Sober"" and ""Prison Sex"". ""Bottom"" and ""4"" were the songs that most indicated the direction the band was going, and though they don't have memorable choruses or riffs like ""Sober"" and ""Prison Sex"" do, they are still more memorable songs overall.So yeah, buy this CD if you're a fan of good music, but if you're on a limited budget, buy ""nima"" first, then System Of A Down's self-titled CD, then Radiohead's ""Kid A"", and then Undertow.",1

Lousy dialogue, lousy chemistry, no humour, ridiculous situations. Nice special effects, and Brandon's performance is actually good.

Jennifer Weiner captures the hilarious and the painful absurdity of life in this excellent story of Cannie, a smart and witty heroine for everyone. While it's easy to say that most people don't have emotionally abusive fathers, late in life lesbian mothers, national magazine humiliation from ex-boyfriends, etc, there isn't a person alive who can't relate to Cannie's trip through the fire of pain and disappointment from those she loves, emerging finally as someone who can love herself. A great deal has been said about Cannie as a ""plus size"" heroine, but really, she is a heroine for anyone who has ever felt inadequate, unworthy, and generally unlovable. In other words, everybody.

I am a big Mary Mary fan. I love both of their original albums. However, this CD has been a big disappointment. The whole thing seems just thrown together. The lyrics from the original songs are frequently lame. Two whole tracks are devoted to the really bad ""California Christmas"" which at best appeals to a very limited demographic living in the southern California area. I don't know about you, but Christmas songs about the ""Cali Way"" don't have much appeal for me. The highly repetitive ""Call Him Jesus"" sounds like any gospel production you can find in small churches around the country. ""The Real Thing,"" ""Hark the Herald..."" and ""Carol of the Bells"" are each OK, but not enough to redeem this CD as a whole. My recommendation is that you put your Christmas music money somewhere else.",0

"A good read for all ages

I'm guessing this book got its young adult label just because one of the characters is an eleven year old boy. If so, I hope that doesn't stop older readers from reading it. This is an intelligent story that broaches some important medical debates that are far from being settled. Wakely's take on those debates- in the form of two opposing characters, who each state their case in convincing fashion- will keep you reading to the touching, clever ending. There's the possibility of a sequel here, although Wakely had better be careful to not just rehash the plot, since it's hard to see how a second book with the same theme could be better than the original. Also read Flowers for Algernon (if you haven't already) since that book is in the same vein as An Audience for Einstein. Recommended.",1
"'Hero' was cheesy and totally not sexy

I honestly don't know a single woman that would have found his obnoxious and grossly inappropriate behavior sexy. He was a sheriff and should have known better, frankly he gave me the willies. The heroine was not realistic, no woman I know would have reacted to those situations the way she did. She should have threatened to press charges on the stalking hero.

Not to mention that making bets like he did is immature and frankly insulting.",0
"One star--just barely.

One of the reasons I read this book was that the customer ratings for it were so high. Readers referred to it as ""haunting"" and ""the best WWII story ever."" I'm truly mystified by these comments.

"A modernist twist on French Horn playing

To begin, I have to admit I found the title of the album misleading. Instead of a mellow, Bach-like baroque deployment of the French Horn, I found myself surprised that it is accompanied by piano, more along the lines of a sort of bawdy Gilbert & Sullivan or Gershwin play/musical score.Trying to find anything I like or find suitable on this album... maybe it reflects a lack of good material for the French Horn.

Being as I first heard them on this album, first saw them while they were touring on this record, I think it's a great place to start. At the time, I had no idea they had 2 previous independent releases but from what I hear this album is a revamped version of ""The Blood Splat Rating System"" for major label release. Powerman were definitely at their prime opening for the likes of Ozzfest 97, Primus and Limp Bizkit before taking over headlining duties once ""Tonight The Stars Revolt!"" was released. If you were to start listening to this band, I would think the time has passed since most of their career gave way to commercial pressure. They were shooting for radio fame instead of continuing this style. I guess the genre was kind of exhausted and Powerman probably needed the ""Transform""ation sound-wise.

For anyone interested in World War II, and/or the Code Talkers, this is an outstanding book. I liked that the author, Judith Schiess Avila, wrote the book in first person, as Chester Nez told his story to her.

If you're interested in this subject, I very much recommend this book for it's information and for it's presentation. It gets a BRAVO from me.",1
"Blues Heaven

My first introduction to Francine Reed was at the Ritz Carlton while visiting Atlanta. She not only enchanted the audience with her haunting and smooth renditions of When Love Was New and What Do I Do, but entertained us with lots of toe tapping R&B. She and her sister, Margo Reed, were fabulous together. This wonderful recording will not only steal your heart, but sweep you away to ""Blues Heaven."" Francine Reed is one of the most versatile jazz/blues vocalists to grace the stage in years and *Shades of Blue* will definitely be a classic!! Keep them coming, Francine!!",1
"waste of money and time

They should have never made this one. What were they thinking except to make more money on the reputation of the previous 2. It is dull, badly written and boring.

"Original, ""Thinking Man's Music""

What a great album. It's heavy and melodic. Every time I listen I hear something new. This amazing album grows on you. It still sounds fresh after many listens. This is what a metal record should be like. The musicians are really skilled, the vocalist really sings; something you don't see often in today's music and manufactured stars. The blending of melody and complexity of the music is somewhere on the lines of Death, Control Denied, Watchtower, Mozart, and Beethoven. Added to this is intelligent lyrics. Those who complain that the music is too technical don't have a long enough attention span and should stick with their korns and limp biscuits. If you like heavy, melodic music with thought provoking lyrics and non-standard song structures played by skilled musicians with heart BUY THIS ALBUM!",1

"Brilliant

A complex album that reaches out at several points and draws you under its spell. Richie explores the really dark and mysterious parts of sub-bass experiences, and creates a soundscape that should serve to send chills up and down your spine in a darkened room, late at night, or in similarly dark situations.I particularly like Disconnect... the lyrics are there to add to the ambience of the track, and really caught my attention the first time I heard it. Had to crank up the volume on that one to get the full sense of the track. Second fav is the last track... the two before it really blend well into it, and close out the disc very nicely.",1

"Big disappointment

I know lots of people thought the first movie in this series (Alien vs. Predator) had a lot lacking, but I still ended up enjoying it. Sure, it couldn't compare to the first Alien or Aliens by any means, but it held some merit nonetheless. But this film is a complete horror to a decent predecessor. The story line lacks direction and it appears that the director just chose to include as much horror as possible to shock value. So while it may have some moments, this is one movie you can avoid.",0
"Reader advice: stop writing.

This is a terrible book. The plot is far-fetched. I had trouble finishing it, and I couldn't care less about any of the characters. Nothing leading up to the climax explained that the ""chicken lady"" was the murderer (if you can call what happened, a murder). Also, the description of how-to kill chickens and boil them for soup, is off-putting. The plot was a mish-mosh of different stories within a story. I have liked most books in the series, but will not read anything else from this author. Don't waste your money on this book.",0

"Wonderful Remake Of A Classic

I am heartsick that this is not available in a USA format. This is one remake that I think holds it's own against the original movie with Marlon Brando and Vivian Leigh. Ann Margaret gives the performance of her career and brings a new dimension to the fragile Blanche du Bois. Treat Williams also gives a very strong performance as the brutish Stanley Kowalski. For diehard Brando fans, they will consider this movie an abomination of Tennessee Williams' play, but if you view it with an open mind, the performances by all are outstanding. I really loved it.",1
"Right - who is this girl ???

There were just too many inconsistencies in this girl to have the story be believable. She supposedly had a mother (for most of her life) who had a wealthy (at least middle class) family. She is totally illiterate and totally a racist even though there doesn't appear to be any racism from her parents (where did she get this). I mean she wouldn't even eat food at her black friend's house. The setting appears to change from the early 70s to the late 80s. She is supposed to be so saavy but we are supposed to believe that she wasn't familiar with the term ""foster family"" and that no social worker explained it to her. I found the poor grammar to be annoying and not even believable. ( I guess we are supposed to believe this girl didn't go to school even though we are also supposed to believe she is pretty smart). I can't recommend this book.",0

What the movie MISSION IMPOSSIBLE did for the TV series of the same name, THE NUDE BOMB does for (to) the TV series Get Smart. This film is absolutely irrepentable!

That way the bad guys, whose clothes must be bomb-gaurded, can blackmail everyone lest they stay nude forever. Only the re-enactments of the crazy spy equipment from the TV series, and brief cameos from original cast members, offer a nominal enthusiasm for this petty disheartening tripe.

"Effective but not much fun to use

I have used this Waterpik every night, before brushing my teeth, for over five months, and I still have to be careful to control the splashing water. It runs out my mouth, as the directions say it should, but it splashes on my hand and all over the sink--sometimes onto the floor. I keep using it because it does a good job of flushing out particles between the teeth, and seems to invigorate the gums. I wish the base was only five inches deep instead of five and one-half, because the depth of glass bathroom shelves is just five inches. The Waterpik would be five inches deep if the cord were attached to a side instead of the back. I also wonder why Waterpik furnishes six different kinds of nozzles when most people probably just need the basic nozzle. I would have been happier if they had provided a couple of extra basic nozzles. Still, I would recommend this as a useful, healthful tool for oral hygiene.",1

Christie Golden takes us back into Byrnian history with this prequel to ""Instrument of Fate."" The definite strengths in this book include her characterization techniques, her background knowledge and her vivid imagery.

Little kids might like it but if you like more substance in your movie than this won't be your cup of tea.

"Too much analysis, not enough biography

For a book in a series of biographies, I got this book expecting just that. Instead I found out only a little about one of my favorite authors, instead being overloaded with critical analysis. Many times Mikkelsen simply judges part of Cooper's work as good or bad with little explanation as to her judgements. Some of her analysis was good and the summaries of Cooper's works were useful, but I believe she did a bit too much analysis. Many times she read into scenes ideas that I did not think Cooper intended, often subjecting the writings to various critical approaches with little regard as to what Ms. Cooper meant when she wrote those scenes. It was just like my high school English classes - overanalyzation (sp?) without any thought of what the writer originally meant or what the average reader will get out of it. Less analysis and more biographical information would have been more pleasing to me.",0

"Great Performances, Great Value of Kubelik & Dvorak

Those on a budget might seriously consider getting this two CD set of Rafael Kubelik conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, in lieu of the multiple CD set of his entire Dvorak symphony cycle. These are electrifying performances every bit as good as Sir Colin Davis' readings with the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Admittedly, the sound quality might not be as splendid as those of recent vintage, yet this is a set worth acquiring. With regards to the quality of the performance, Kubelik's 1960's account is as fine as the latest I have heard from the likes of Abbado and Harnoncourt. This two CD compilation concludes with Kubelik's celebrated version with the Boston Symphony Orchestra of the tone poem Moldau from Smetana's tone poem cycle Ma Vlast.",1

The story of 4 astronauts who get caught in a solar storm and survive, but with their DNA severely altered. They develop superpowers and become the Fantastic Four. I didn't read the comic books so I don't care how it stacks up to them. The movie taken by itself is pretty bad. There is very little set-up to explain who everyone is and what exactly they're doing in space. In fact, throughout the entire movie there is little character development. The only person who actually acts in the film is Michael Chiklis as The Thing. Everyone else give awful performances, especially Jessica Alba. They're not helped by the atrocious dialog they have to say. The script must have taken about 20 minutes to write.

"Warning - HD ""Crop"" of Original TV Aspect Ratio!

This series looked great when it debuted on DVD back in the last decade. I've loved this show for years, and watch it regularly on reruns, in addition. What they have done here, is repackage the ""HD"" transfers done for FX Network. They have cropped a little off of the top of the picture, and a lot off of the bottom. In some shots from the Pilot, in Eric's POV sequence, you can't even see the top of Bob's fro, which is the entire point of the gag. I wish Fox had been more faithful to the creators, and kept the orignal 1.33:1 aspect ratio for SD television broadcasts. Or even put both versions on the disc, it's only mega blu-ray storage. Overall, extremely disappointed with this package, as it's the best season of the show IMO, crap presentation (yes the picture does look as nice as it did on FX but cropped). Thumbs down.",0

I thought far too much of the book was used discussing how male dominated the work force is.

I rated it 2 stars instead of 1 star because there were some useful parts of the book unrelated to favoring white males. I learned some ways to better stand up for myself and reword my requests so I sound stronger. Although there were some good points, overall the book was too feminist for me (even though of course I'm for women's rights, that's just not the problem I'm dealing with right now), and a little too anti white male (my white husband is currently my best support system).

I gave it 2 stars for the looks and padding",0

"music really adds to the movie

Alright, first off I'm not some kind of black eyeliner wearing goth lover who enjoys being depressed all the time. I am a fan of classic horror and there is no greater originator of classic horror than Nosferatu. Here we have a version with an updated score consisting of three minute fragments of not nessisarily heavy metal gothic music but just overall errie sounding. I liked it. As far as the movie goes I've read that there are better coppies out there but unfortunaltly I have been unable to find one where certain parts are not cropped. Still, a teriffic movie even if Barbra Strisand had done the score which might actually be scarier.",1
"Awful, one of the worst books existing

I tried reading this book first when I was five, with my mom, then when I was twelve. It was horrible each time. I remember distictly suffering through it up to the part where Meg makes jam, then deciding it wasn't worth my time. My mom hated it each time she read it too.The movie, however, with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, is very good. If you want to know the story and not suffer, see the movie, which is quite good.",0

Bought this from amazon a few months back and really worked well for about 3 months, then the lid started acting funny. It opens sometimes and other times just opens a bit and shuts down.

"BEADS FALL OFF STRING

I WANT to love these lacing beads. We should be able to love these lacing beads! They are, after all Melissa and Doug, the toy brand that we all love. But I really dislike them.The strings have nothing to stop the beads from falling off. Even double knotting the end of the string does not keep the large beads from slipping.This is very frustrating for a three year old.We instead end up using this for sorting and patterns. Too bad we can't use it to 'lace'.",0
"This has been one of the nicest books.

Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul is a really good book. It's nice to hear stories from other people, not just the authors.

They are really worth buying.",1

"junk -- works, then stops working, works randomly

I didn't have any trouble following directions and configuring this device for my garage door (one of them). So of course it worked right away, and I was happy. A little while later I wanted to demonstrate it for someone else, to confirm that it did indeed work. Oops, demo failed! Try again. So I put it away saying I need to check the config. Tried it again a day later (without any re-config), it worked. Then didn't. It seems to be sending a signal (the led is flashing), so I suspect that the electronics is faulty, causing it to send incorrect signals with some randomness.So no excuses, no support calls, this is now classified as a junk product. It should just work, the way my regular door openers work, and the cars (homelink) work, every time without fail.",0

I bought this book a few months back. It is a good read. It helps you with the basic concepts. Not too thrilled with the attached software. There are better ones out there (free).The primary drawback of this book is that there are no examples to elucidate the concepts. What the author should have done was for each of the topics, use an actual horoscope and explained the concepts from there. This way one gets a better understanding of astrology.So now I am on the lookout for another book that has some examples.",0

After 10 minutes I gave up on the film. Why? One reason, the lead actress is extremely unattractive. Why would Sam Mendes do this?

Is this why they have now broken up?I love Jim from the office, John Kranski, but lost respect for his character in the opening scene, cmon man, you can do better.One star as amazon won't allow no star.I heard it was funny.I like Sam Mendes.The girl was very unattractive and I like looking at gorgeous girls when I watch a film.",0

(acknowledged during the credits)This gives you a clue about the reason for the making of this film at the (victorious) end of the war in 1945.Americans (I'm one) have short memories. Very short. The OSM judged there was adverse public reaction to the abandonment of the Philippines in 1942. The film counters, or blunts, the question, ""why did we pull out when we won the war anyway?""Of course, the question is highly illogical but whoever said the general public is able to formulate logical questions?What is being ""strategically managed"" is the manipulation of public opinion.(I would have preferred giving a no-star review.)",0

I couldn't wait till this book came out but after reading it I wish I would have saved my money. It lacks any convincing arguments that the other two books contained.

Plus, the story by the lawyer is so dry and impersonal it read like an apologetics text book.Patrick, WHAT happened????",0

Seeing as though they're on Sub Pop, you would think these guys would be half way popular. Seeing as though they're a great band, you would think they'd have more fans.""Knock Knock Knock"" is one of my all time favorite EP's. What it lacks in length, it makes up in quality. Hot Hot Heat has a unique sound, but they fit somewhere in between the punk rock of the 70's and the dance of the 80's. If that's a bad comparison, just listen to the music instead.The standout tracks on this EP are ""5 Times out of 100"" and ""Touch You Touch You.""

The Broadway version was better than the movie due to the fact the songs were much improved and better.

Reminds of some garage bands I've heard in the past. This is one of those CD's you play once and say, Hmmmm - Interesting but never play it again. If you're looking to buy a Missing Persons CD - choose something else, make this one your last MP selection.

I ordered it and got it. it was new, HOWEVER the screen printed characters on the keys were very poorly aligned, some were almost 15 degrees off center... No big deal for the price (Caveat Emptor) My gripe was the screenprinting of the characters wore off on heavily used keys in a couple months...Keep in mind that theres a reason these are 10-15 bucks, and purchase accordingly. the only gripe i have is the poor quality of the screenprinting...

"N is Not Grafton's Best

I must agree with other reviewers that ""N is for Noose"" is well below par for Sue Grafton. I think Ms. Grafton is attempting to ""round out"" Kinsey - she attempted this in N by having Kinsey become frightened after an attack. Sure, show that Kinsey is human and gets scared like the rest of us but do not forsake the other elements of her character, especially her sarcastic wit, while doing so. As with the last few Grafton books, K is for Killer, L is for Lawless and now N is for Noose, I find that I neither care about the problems of the characters (M is for Malice was the exception to this) nor do I care about the resolution of the case. Perhaps Ms. Grafton should go back and read her earlier works to help herself devise more interesting plots for the remaining novels in the series. This reader strongly feels that unless the quality of plot strengthens significantly, I'll stop reading (and buying) Ms. Grafton's books long before she makes it to Z.",0

It is like the end of the movie ""Nerds"", when everyone comes down and proclaims themselves to be nerds.For everyone who has ever been picked on by the ""jocks"" or just been made fun of their apperance and wishes they could do something about it. For those who like to see the good guy take the fall for the good of another. This book is for you.",1

"Darling, I Love You, but Give Me Park Avenue!

I'm wondering if the people who've panned this book are: angry with themselves for not doing anything with their lives; for not doing ""their thing"" to the best of their ability; or if they're one of these people who have suddenly realized they live in an armpit of America and resent ""big city folk.""Also, a word to Floyd of North Carolina: Your money would have been better spent in purchasing the latest edition of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and a copy of ""Strunk and White's.""Oh, but the book! I enjoyed it simply because I'm interested in what makes successful people tick. At times, I do think Trump is obnoxious and stuck in an 80's mindset, but I also feel he's earned the right. Would you be shuffling down 5th Avenue with your head down if you were in his shoes?",1

"Wondertastic-ish! That is, if you skip Knuckles's songs.

Sonic Adventure 2 on the Dreamcast had one of the best soundtracks available for the system, and it really made the gameplay stand out among the 'Super Mario's and 'Megaman X's in the wide world of gaming. And, I suspect after many MANY requests, they've finally decided to come out with the soundtrack. About time! The Rock and Techno beats are kickin', but I couldn't give it five stars due to the fairly annoying Rap and Austin Powers-style music that adorn Knuckles's and Rouge's (respectively) tunes. But make no mistake; Sonic and Shadow's songs will please ANYONE that appreciates Rock 'n Rave, and if you wanted to hear the complete versions of ""Live and Learn"" and (the awesome) theme from Sonic's first level, your wish has been granted. Adrenaline rushes abound. Enjoy music? Get it! There's a little of everything on this CD ...excluding Country, of course.",1

"Mix of everything

BT tries to combine a variety of styles and genres here on this cd, while he is mostly known for sweeping trance ballads this cd has it's share of departures to other areas. There are 2 tracks that are very rock influenced almost alternative in nature, then there are also a few hip hop songs that arent too bad.Mostly ofcourse the cd stands out because of it's whole compilation of everything above with Godspeed, Mercury & Solace and Dreaming. All of these have been featured on countless other DJ albums and compilations but they are in their original form here and not re-mixed.This is pretty much a feel good album, you cant go wrong, hopefully BT will release an albun where he dedicated himself fully to what he does best - mix and produce.",1

What we have here are assembly instructions for 'meals' that are geared more towards a 10 year old latch-key kid than towards any male adult interested in healthy eating.

I was given this as a gift. My Husband knew I needed a portable speaker system for my Sandisk Sansa Mp3 player to use in the bathroom, outside, or around the house if needed. It isnt a Dock for the Mp3 player, your device wont sit snug in the middle, it hooks up via a connector to your Mp3 player and there is a place for it to sit. Its nice looking, compact and sleek, it comes with alot of different sizes of ""docks"" for whatever MP3 player you have and those all have to go somewhere if you arent using them. It also comes with a carrying case, which the plug fits nicely in and its sturdy material.My one wish is that it would be louder, there isnt much OOOMPH to its speakers so if you take it with you outside make sure its not somewhere loud, but this wasnt meant to be used as a stand alone speaker system for the beach, it would be better to get a Portable CD player, or another system that has bigger speakers!",1

"A first class series with third rate sound

The sound on this DVD is terrible. It is not possible to hear the narration when the level is set for the music score. With the level set for the narration, the music track is too loud for the music-only passages.The narration on these DVDs, when you can hear it, sounds thin and reedy, as if it was fed through a telephone line.This problem has nothing to do with the age of the original material. I have Victory at Sea on laser disc. The audio on them is fine when played through my TV or through the same sound system that I use for DVD. The sound was fine on the VHS release. The sound has been consistently fine when the series was shown on TV over the years. And the sound, with Richard Rogers acclaimed score, was fine when the series first ran on NBC when I was a boy.This versionis much better.

While the publication date for this book is listed as 2009, I couldn't help but be severely disappointed in the age of the content of most of this book.

Some of the explanations reached as far back as NT3.5.The book also primarily focuses on Fibre-Channel and Network Attached Storage as these were the only available option in its space in 2002. Time has moved on, of course, but for the 2009 update a mere addendum with a few pages of coverage for iSCSI was included.Note carefully the dates of the reviews praising this title. I'm sure it was in fact an excellent book in its day, but the 2009 publication date is more than a little deceptive.",0

She has to travel to an island to check on her sick sister who lives with her husband and his brother, a proud and passionate italian, signore Romano.Upon meeting their relationship is one of challenge and deep provacation. Romano does call Nicky on her life decisions and her fear to face the world, her complexes and the starting attraction between them.Dialogues are fun and very fast paced, the plot and drama keeps you reading until you turn the last page! The characters are unforgettable, especially the failing Nicky.I place this romance among the top 5 I've read from Harlequin.",1

Eley is one of the more prominent radical leftists at a radical left university so you should not expect much balance in his writing. But I did try to get through this book with an open mind and must say that about half of the book has some interesting historical events in it. The problem is that most of these events are shaded and slanted in such a way as to make this book useless to anyone who has studied history and historical movements. Eley is a classic radical who really has no appreciation for competing thoughts or ideas other than his leftist view of the world. The fact that the Soviet Union kind of falls off a cliff in the book when its obvious failures killed this evil philosophy and economic system is most telling. But he will continue to write this kind of drivel, pounding nonsense into the kids in his classrooms, and make a lot of money from hard working taxpayers for doing so.",0

Most people haven't heard of Static-X or Kittie, and the songs they picked to include by these artists give you a good idea of what their own albums will be like.

It takes more than surviving a harrowing experience to inspire a good book. The situation this family endured deserves better treatment than it gets here. Malika Oufkir's view of the social and political scene, which could have offered brilliant insight into a world hidden from our view, was that of a naive and uneducated teenager: uninformed and self-centered. Perhaps this is the result of being imprisoned in a desert for 20 years. Besides its disappointingly limited scope, an inept author was chosen to collaborate on this project. The writing of this first-person narrative was trite. Instead of being captivated by this family's plight, I found myself playing a distracting game of count-the-cliches, with at least one on every page. Good books combine a fascinating story and brilliant command of the written word. Neither element is evident here.",0

I've enjoyed the Donavan series that Elizabeth Lowell wrote. I must confess that on this book, I was completely lost with the characters. I found myself flipping back to see who the characters were and what their job was. The story line was good, the gem information was interesting and I enjoyed the relationship building between the two main characters. I was glad that I was not able to figure out who the killer was until the last few pages. The suspense was very good. I suggest to anyone reading this book to start a list of the characters and use that as a book mark.",0

I played the demo on easy, and found that the AI was actually intelligent.

In fact, while assaulting a house, one soldier went around the house and wasted my team member from behind.

When it was discussed and considered that this book might be removed from our school library, I of course had to see why. Our author includes a character who uses some ""colorful language.""

This is the worst album I have ever heard. It doesn't even deserve to be called punk. It is so unoriginal, it's all been done before.

I came across this and it looked like it would fit the bill.I wasn't expecting much as it was a Halloween costume. THe quality is great and my son, Max, just loves wearing it around.

"Jesus Died on Earth : The point is missed in the book

The book writes in detail trying to justify that Jesus did not die and that he was raised alive. The author is bound in his own domain and could not comprehend the teaching of Islam. If Jesus was raised ""to Allah"" - does Allah have a physical body towards which He raised Jesus? The verse 3:54 clearly says Allah will cause Jesus's death before he can be raised. Death must happen before he can be raised in any manner. The book misses this point. It reiterates Hadith to claim that Jesus is alive - but Quran specifically said he is dead. If not, then Quran is full of contradiction. All scholars agree the meaning of ""wafat"" is death but in this verse they disagree! I recommend you read a web site www.geocities.com/Athens/Cyprus/8878 to know what may have happened to Jesus. I neither recommend nor discourage anybody from reading this book. Allah has given you mind and intelligence to be your own judge.",0

"A moustache on the Mona Lisa. . .

As if Wagner's music and poetry could not be trusted, this ""controversial"" (read STUPID) production is like a trash bag fullof silly tricks. Act I is garishly staged on a cartoonish yacht (harsh lighting, primary colors, the set like a childs paper cut out), the potionsplaced in highball glasses, Tristan SHAVES for almost theentire act (What in the WORLD does it mean???). Act II fareslittle better, with Tristan rolling on a floral divan on which to sing.Act III does redeem the whole affair somewhat, with its slideshowof Tristans childhood memories and muted palette of colors.Mehta looks embarrassed from the get go, but the orchestra plays beautifully, and the principal singers persevere despite the foolishnessthey are called upon to suffer (did I mention the COSTUMES???).Just AVOID this, especially if it is your first Tristan: you'll neverreturn to this opera if this travesty is your maiden voyage.

Did not love this book. I found myself starting to just skim it because I lost interest after the second chapter. It is very repetitive and for me it was nothing that I hadn't already heard before about soothing a fussy baby. I had twin babies - who I believe both were colicky - and I didn't refer to this book once. I think most of the methods described are common knowledge. Also, there is a lot of talk about the missing ""fourth trimester"" and how mothers in other countries raise babies. To me, it was not relevant. I would suggest using your instinct, talk to other mothers, and do some research online and you will save yourself time and money.",0

I began reading this book thinking it would be an intelligent (as opposed to Lahaye's Left Behind) interpretation of Revelations. Nope, not even close.

At first I was thinking, OK, this must be the AntiChrist - pretty good portrayal. Then, two thirds of the way through, I finally gave up.

I enjoyed this book (and its sequel) much more than the star scroll books.

My nephews love these DVD's. They watch them over and over. The stories are diverse, well-illustrated, and most have engaging music. The only disappointment for my older nephew was that the Curious George story featured an older version of the story versus the ""new"" monkey character currently seen on PBS. One thing to keep in mind when purchasing these dvd's are that if your child currently enjoys Star Wars, Spiderman, etc. he/she may find these stories a little boring, as the pacing is much slower than alot of what is currently on television for kids. My nephews really enjoy the scholastic stories at the ages of 2 and 4 but they are not allowed to watch most regular childrens television shows or cartoons.",1

DiCaprio is a spy. The greatest dangers he faces are not the terrorists but his boss, a gung-ho glory jockey played by Russell Crowe, and Crowe's rival for the command post, a stereotypical brain-dead but obstinately arrogant bureaucrat that the civil services breed like rats. No matter what happens, it is only a matter of time before DiCaprio gets screwed.DiCaprio wants to establish trust with the anti-terror unit he works with, so he can eventually nail the top terrorists. But Crowe is too impatient, and will take any risk, abuse any relationship and burn any asset for a quick result that he can show off to the big boss to boost his career, even if it means getting his own agents killed.It is a very revealing look at how a US agency works, very realistic and a great eye-opener.

"a little less fat, but alot less rewarding

The low-fat craze that was the rage in the 1980s and 1990s is continuing to wane, due in part to the increasing obesity and the realization that ""low fat"" doesn't necessarily mean ""more healthy."" This complete cooking light cookbook has recipies that, by and large, result in less flavorful and less ""competent"" cooking, with (in my opinion, at least) minimal ""health"" advantages vis-a-vis any reasonable cooking practices. Take the chicken pot pie recipie in this book, for example. Following this recipe results in a bland, very watery mess -- toped with hardened chunks of crust made with flower and butter. Neither the filling, nor the crust, will leave you satisfied. (Don't they test the recipes?) Anyway, I gave it two stars for some low fat desserts that were not terrible.

I will go with the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words and post photos of some of the details of this set instead of launching into a written description; in a nutshell, the board and game pieces are absolutely beautifully crafted. I agree with other reviewers that the main downsides are: 1) can't expand this to include 5+ players (unless one buys a second set and uses the brown and green game pieces from the standard set -- hmmm...) and can't incorporate expansions such as Seafarers and 2) the number chits are very hard to see and rest awkwardly on the land hexes (I think next time I will try using the standard number chits -- at least they are a bit smaller and will be easier to see).

"A fairly interesting story, but...

The movie completely ruins Kubrick's masterpiece. Why? It takes the allure away from the original. It forces viewers to conform to Arthur Clark's view of what happened in 2001. For people who love being spoon-fed, and love not thinking, 2010 is a much better movie that 2001. But what makes Shakespeare so great, or the Bible such a literary masterpiece? Much of it is multiple interpretations readers can form in their own mind, which also carries over to film. In 2001, I was perfectly content believing that HAL really did have a problem and covered it up by killing crew members. Well, 2010 ruined that with the terrible story line of HAL being programmed to do it by 'the bad guys.' No thanks... stay away free-thinkers, this will ruin the original.",0

The first time I heard this album I said to myself that it was a little different, and I guess I kinda liked it because of that. But to be perfectly honest this album never found its way back into my CD player after that. Her voice is far from incredible, and the songs are all pre-fabricated to suit her breathy, sugary voice and that got really old. Although the traditional teen-pop songs may finally be getting old, the material on this album will not be able to carry Mandy into the next generation as hard as she may try. At this point in her career, she is more of and actress and a personality than a musician. Already there are signs that this album will be a flop, and just because it is different doesn't mean it will be successful.

"God-awful adaptation

You cannot be a fan of Stephen King's classic book, ""'Salem's Lot"", and think that this was a good adaptation.Apparently this nightmare was supposed to be based on the Stephen King book ""'Salem's Lot"", but after watching it I was left wondering. It is very clear that there was a concerted effort to ""re-imagine"" and update the original story in order to make it appeal to a new audience, but fans of the book will hate what's been done here. When I heard that 'Salem's Lot was being made into a mini-series, I was very excited because it's my favorite King book. Also, recent adaptation have been good (The Shining) or even excellent (The Stand). But oh boy, what a let down it turned out to be. The flow of the movie is disjointed and inconsistent, and there are major deviations from the plot of the book. Not to mention how boring this thing is.In case you really want to watch this heap of crap, I won't spoil it for you. But wait until you get a load of how this things ends!",0
"Mediocre - o.k. at best. They have better.

What A Life (released mid 80s)is by far their least enjoyable album. Kind of rough around the edges and not as well written, it is a mediocre 2nd effort (as is usual with artists). The one great track is ""Pleasure and Pain"". Their debut ""Desperate""('83 or so),""Temperamental""(1988)and the self titled ""Divinyls""(1990)(that had that interesting Masturbations song) were far more superior works. So if you want a good album try this - but if you want a good Divinyls album try elsewhere.",0

"Too Much Violence -- Not enough Val Kilmer

I finally got a chance to watch the DVD ""2:22"" and was very disappointed, first in the extreme violence I was so disgusted when the jerk hit the dog. I hate violence and even more when it is violence against a animal. Then I was shocked that Val Kilmer was on the screen for only a small part of the DVD. I am a Big Fan of Val Kilmer and bought this DVD without knowing to much about it because it seemed Val was starring in it. They should have listed Val as a cameo. I will not recommend this movie to anyone.",0
"Comprehensive but boring

This is a very comprehensive textbook of the subject. It deals with just about every aspect of the AIS realm. It is, however, a very dull book. There isn't much illustrating, no color, and absolutely no life beyond the black and white wasteland of its pages.",0

"OVER RATED!

I had heard so much about this movie that I couldn't wait to see it. I was very dissapointed.I am a big Disney fan so this review is not anti-Disney.Much like movies based upon video games, movies based upon theme park rides just don't work. Or haven't worked yet. This movie had everything you could ask for. Major Stars, Major Director, Major Producer but NO PLOT. That is not fair of course it had a plot, just not a good one. And the plot that they did have has so many holes in it that as the end I was left asking myself ""did I really just see what I thought I did?""Special effects were great, but once again studios don't care about the writing. How can you have a good movie without a good script?But it all comes down to box office and since this one made millions, there will be more like it and the Hulk and Dare Devil and the list could go on forever.Save your time and money. Skip this one.BUTAt least it wasn't Charlie's Angels 2",0

"Me, Myself and I

I really tried to get into this book, but I agree with the 400+ other 1 star ratings that the character is all about herself and woo is me. Let's get the Klennex out and cry some more. The book was depressing, all about herself and didn't really care about anything else. I had no empathy for the dear women even after she listed her various anti-depression drugs. I've been in a depressed state at one point in my left and I certainly didn't leave my family and run off to Italy and the likes! Stay home and deal with it! I didn't find the book have any spirituality value AT ALL. The movie had better find some quality plot or it will be a flop too.",0
"Melancholy Soldier

De Rocca's memoir of the war in Spain is far less well-known than that of his hussar colleague Jean Marbot but makes for excellent reading (& probably far less given to exaggeration). Greenhill should be thanked for adding this short work to their Napoleonic Library - an affordable addition to any Peninsular collection. De Rocca's description of the insurgency leaves little to the imagination and certainly makes understandable the French failure to conquer the Spanish people. Any student of the Peninsula should pick this up as should those studying counterinsurgency. De Rocca later went on to wed the formidable Madame de Stael in a love match. We're lucky to have such a memoir by an intelligent, thoughtful campaigner. See also Memoirs of Colonel Bugeaud and the thoroughly readable Recollections of Colonel de Gonneville.",1
"Not as sharp as before?

Got these 3 packs of Merkur razor blades from DERazorblades. The Merkur blades I've had before were very sharp. These were surprisingly dull, even from the first use.

Amazon's great customer service did give me a refund.",0
"mickey mouse pancaker

This is advertised as a waffle maker, but it is not. There is not a ridge or waffle involved. It is a pancake form of Mickey Mouse. The old version which was discontinued was a waffler, and photo they use shows the waffle that the previous item produced. The new Mickey Mouse Waffler would not show up well since there is no depth to the facial features, and there is only a hint of an outline of the face of Mickey Mouse.If you truly want a waffle maker this is not one.",0
"Good message damaged by preachy presentation

While my 3-1/2 year old daughter seems to like this book well enough, I dislike reading it to her. The message is a positive one (we're all different in some way) and relies on interesting examples (food allergies, for example). However, the overall product is preachy and rather dull. Without a plot, just a series of kids who each describe the way in which they are different, it isn't much fun to read.",0
"Poor Quality

Causes extreme ghosting on monitor. I expect this is due to the fact that the cable has very thin shielding -- much less than a standard 6ft monitor cable. I bought this because I wanted to get my computer off my desk and out of the way, but was completely useless to me. Threw it away.",0
"important study on Azerbaijani issue in Iran

As seen from previous review the topic itself is complex, emotional and sensitive. People from Iran and Azerbaijan will differ their opinion on the subject of the book - the identity of Azerbaijanis in Iran. But the problem of Azerbaijani identity in Iran exists despite the denial of Iranians. Yes, some part of Azerbaijani population align themself with Iranian state and culture. But the significant other portion DO NOT. And this problem emerged not yesterday - we have to recall the attempt of Iranian Azerbaijanis to create its own state and unite with North in 1945-46 (I would advise Turaj Atabaki's book on this subject). With current Iranian regime, supression of Azerbaijani language and culture, the problem is going to be exacerbated. Brenda Shaffer did a good job enlighting this problem in last two decades of the XX century - aftermath of Iranian revolution, collapse of USSR and the establishment of independent Azerbaijan.",1

"Can I get less repetition?

A local station, KMTT, has been playing Tedeschi's album for a couple years now and to be completely honest, I AM SICK OF IT! If I hear the amazingly redundant ""You Need to Be with Me"" (or any other of her songs for that matter) again, I will throw up! Granted, Tedeschi has talent and a great persona but she is no Bonnie Raitt and she is certainly not Janis Joplin reincarnated! Now, she is nominated for a Grammy for best new artist almost two years after the release of ""Just Won't Burn""? It befuddles the mind! Oh well! If you love the sound of someone playing the same 5 chords and repeating the same lyric over and over, buy this album. I guarantee that you will throw it away soon after.",0

"Propaganda

This is not a scientific or reasonable book. It is propaganda, plain and simple. The fallacious arguments put forth in this book are hardly worth refuting if you have any actual understanding of the science of evolutionary biology, but for the average, non-scientific individual this book pulls out every dirty bit of sleight of hand there is to convince them of it's message: evolution is evil and atheistic, creation is the only answer.They misquote people, misrepresent evidence, quote quacks and frauds, play games with probabilities, claim that scientists ""don't know"" things that have been known for decades, and do an awful lot of hand-waving to distract the reader from the fact that they are not making any sense.A horrific crime against reason and dignity.

I, like the previous reviewers, pre-ordered this thinking it was the first official documentary about Radiohead. However, this DVD is nothing more than the older unauthorized documentary, ""Homework"", re-released with new, more official looking cover art, and a new title. But, when they changed the title on the package, and on the disc art, they forgot to change it in the actual documentary, so the disc menu and the opening credits still say ""HOMEWORK"".

"Awesome!

I have passed this book on to more mothers. It is a lifesaver when you have a newborn. The moms have all found it very useful and the method has worked for them as well. Out of all of us, I was the only new mom, and they couldn't believe how well it worked. Its a simple concept. But as new moms, sometimes we need that advice that walks us through what to do. I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. My son was sleeping five hours right off the bat, and by the time he was 6 weeks he was sleeping 8hours a night and at 8 weeks he was up to 10-12 hours. It was glorious. And now, as a 3 year old, he is still doing great.

"Totally dated and unhelpful

This book, as well as almost all the Barron's pet books, are really nothing but photos which are pretty and scanty information that is not even accurate in many ways. Many are written by Europeans back in the 90s or early 2000s and continue to promote poor diets, dated caging suggestions and often ignore other vital issues of husbandry such as enrichment and foraging opportunities, the necessity of flight, and the reality and need to manage behavioral issues such as territorial aggression which is often a problem with conures. All the Barron's bird books also go heavily into and are supportive of breeding which in this day and age is unethical given the thousands of conures being dumped on parrot rescues across the country. Don't waste your money or valuable time on this book....go online and find out how to properly care for your conure from updated websites that cover the challenges and requirements of conure ownership and not just the bare minimum.",0

"No basis for the author's claims

The author lists many causes of gum disease, including stress, but does not give any references to peer-reviewed studies. Similarly, she recommends many natural products, such as rosemary toothpaste for ""activating the metabolism of the outer layer of gum tissue to improve cell regeneration"", but does not give any references. Because she does not cite bases for her claims, I have very little confidence in her recommendations. She also discusses the use of ""heart energy"" and meridians that connect the teeth to other parts of the body. I'm not saying these modalities are phony, but the lack of observable evidence of their efficacy makes me reluctant to pursue them. I would try ""Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye"" if you are looking for a book that incorporates peer-reviewed studies. Its a good place to start.",0

"Easy Storage

The carts were very simple to put together. It took us about 20 minutes to put 4 of them together. They roll in and out fine, and clear the underneath of the bed with room to spare.It was instantly obvious that the carts are not intended for heavy items. The contruction is very basic and sags in the middle if you put large/heavy items in them.They are perfect for storing clothing under the bed. I also have my younger kids toys in them - and they hold quite well.For the price, these are a great purchase if you are looking for quick access to your stored items.If you are looking for something durable or protective, this may not be what you are looking for. For example, when my kids pull the carts out to get toys, they automatically want to climb in the cart and it falls apart. But it does go back together easily after that.Also, I might add that the wheels are okay. So when they roll on moderately thick carpet I am not sure that they are superior to a plastic tub without wheels.",1
"FUNCTION = 5 STARS, DISPLAY = 1 STAR

Even my 24-year-old daughter, who has perfect vision, cannot read the lettering without difficulty.

Denise Richards is a nuclear scientist (!) who wears tight fitting tops and hot pants instead of the white coat.Director Michael Apted seemed an odd choice to me and he has succeeded in making every single scene as dull and leaden and unimpressive as it is possible.Watch this movie only if you are a Bond fan. If you watch them just like any other movie though...do NOT waste your cash.",0
"YEAH! ;}

Another great game from Sunstorm and WizardWorks, African Safari Trophy Hunter is the best african hunting sim out there. Again, the animals are smart, and if an elephant thinks you're a threat, it'll charge ya, and if you don't find a tree to climb quick, then yer a nice gooey crater in the ground. There are also Kudu, Elond, and Zebra.",1
"Modification

When installing the new ash catcher I realized that a 12"" alum. pie pan fits perfectly on top. I then cut a 1"" hole on the bottom of the grillso I can sweep the ashes directly into the pie pan with no spill.It looks like the newer generation grills dump in the same fashion.Easier is better and a lot cleaner.Berne",1
"Fond Memories

I read this book many years ago, and decided to delve into it again.It is an enjoyable read and fast paced, as most of the Xanth books are. When Ivy, the tiny princess befriends the most formidable dragon in the land, after things get a little wacky with a misplaced splash of youth elixir, you know only interesting things can happen from that point forth.The Xanth books are fun because they are like Saturday morning cartoons...pure enjoyment with no pressure to come away with deep meaning, heavy philosophical conclusions, or reflective insights. They are there, if one wishes to look for them, but I don;t think that Piers Anthony ever meant for this series to be that way. I think they are meant o be just what they are. Fun to read.",1

If they won't stay on your head there is no need to comment on the sound. I can't imagine anyone being satisfied with the fit unless they have a square head. I have a fairly normal sized head and they are very loose fitting. They fall off when I move my head. Worst fit for head phones I have seen. I modified mine and they are somewhat improved but still objectionable. A waste of money.",0

Fabulous. I've had it for weeks now and am still playing it on repeat and liking it more and more.

No bad songs on it.",1
"Best Oil album out of a large catalog

This is an incredible album from a very talented band known in the U.S. for their one hit ""Beds Are Burning"". If you are a fan of just that one song this album may not be for you. It does include a little pop sensiblity in the way of ""When The Generals Talk"" and ""Who Can Stand In The Way"", but most of the albums has strange indigineous Australian instruments as well as some great orchestration. Songs like ""Bells..."" and ""Shipyards Of New Zealand"" have constant time changes and varieties of music styles within the songs themselves. It is not a perfect album with small flaws such as the strange instrumental ""Bakerman"" which does however fit into the flow of this weird album. Overall, it is possibly the best Midnight Oil album out there and that's saying a lot about a band that has such a large and impressive catalog.",1

"A Film--not a ""movie.""

I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""War Bride."" Having been raised during the war, I remember many of the aspects depicted in this film--and for the most part--they were quite authentic.The story takes unexepected turns and the acting is very good. Charlie's reaction to his war service was great and extremely believeable. His spunky bride kept our attention and helped move along an otherwise sad situation which, in fact, was suffered by hundreds of thousands of average folks during the second world war.I am buying this film for my children so they will see what life was like at a time when things were so very different from today.Kudos to those who record a time when life was tough, exciting, romantic and horrific all at the same time.",1

Better than watching paint dry.....but not by much! Such a shame because if only the movie had a better ending I might not have felt like I wasted my time.

"Why wont they make a 0 star button?

Plot line good, acting good, effects sucked very badly. Everything was looking good until I saw the hairless rats that were so overly the top cgi generated it looked like a pixar movie. Then it got worse from there, the villans were all cgi and you could tell they were all computer generated because nothing looked even remotely realistic about them. I have concluded that WB studios are lazy and do not care a thing about how the audience feels. When it boils down to WB movies I've noticed where they are relying too much on CGI and none of it looks real. I made the mistake of buying this movie, and am stuck with it and the loss of $20.00. So in conclusion, if there is another movie that is horror that is produced by WB I will break down and get a blockbuster card and rent it before I blow my cash on a piece of junk like this again.",0

"What kind of friends would you win by reading this?

Russell's slim volume is a jaded, cynical whirlwind of hackneyed metaphors (""Isn't that what Xena would do?"") and knee-jerk advice for those who want to reduce people to quick, sound-byte sized definitions. I don't believe that ""all women are questioning the very definition of love"" (p. 149), just those that have finished reading this book and want to pattern themselves on the author. And can anyone, male or female, take seriously Russell's pigeonholing of personality types? It seems she wants to encourage women to find a deep, lasting relationship by using shallow, witty-for-the-moment quips that will most likely be forgotten faster than last month's headline news.",0

"An erotic love story for Nineties.

I enjoyed Exit to Eden for the simple reason that I love Anne Rice. But on a more specific note I would say that the character development really pulls you into the mystery of this island paradise/training facility. The subject matter is completely appropriate for the love story which unfolds towards the end of the book.I particularly like the way the book ends for the obvious ""happy ending"" reasons but also for the ""bring you back down to earth"" feeling it leaves you with, after being taken so far from reality it deposits you right back into everday life.Very enjoyable reading. Perfect for the beach or a rainy day.",1
"Very comprehensive - Excellent!

I am just beginning with fabric arts and this book was just what I was looking for. I had never done beading on fabric before. This book gave a little history, talked about supplies and showed several basic steps. It had several nice projects to work on as well as several lovely pictures of other artists' work. It also goes into color theory and talk about design which I only skimmed over, but that's just me. Overall, very, very helpful for someone starting out in this area.",1

"Robby Benson meets Dave Matthews

Judging from this guy's rising popularity, there's plenty of room for squares. Dave Matthews should take this guy to court for ripping him off to the point of even copying his knock-kneed stage moves.

"Why go to extremes

Mr. Dobson does not seem to understand that there is a ""happy middle ground"" between permissive parenting (a la ""Smart Love"") and the corporal punishment which he approves of. Why not try Anthony Wolf's book ""The Secret of Parenting""? Dr. Wolf rejects the need for punishment, but he also thinks its wrong to think that children should always be made happy and not have to do what they want (as is recomended in ""Smart Love"") The philosophy in Dr. Wolf's book is that you as a parent must be in charge but that harsh punishment simply is not necessary to get well behaved kids. Dobson's book is bad because it inflicts punishment when it isn't necessary. I say try something like The Secret of Parenting before deciding its necessary to hit your kids.",0

This video is difficult to appreciate since it does not represent anything that I have been taught. There are more enough free short kendo videos on the Internet to gain some appreciation of the art. Anthony Bourdain's video at [...] demonstrates a better representation of the art that I know then the type of Kendo that this person professes to understand.

This CD, along with ""End on End"" by Rites of Spring and ""Analphabetapolothology"" by Cap'n Jazz, composes what I like to call the Holy Trinity of Emo.Native Nod best exemplifies the genre during it's middle period. Arpeggiated guitars, shifting tempos and dynamics, driving rhythms, and frantic vocals. You couldn't ask for more.Standouts include ""Bread"", ""High Tide in Alaska"", ""Tangled"" (If you listen closely during the break, you can hear lead singer Chris Leo verge on tears), and ""Lower GI Bleed"".The only thing that prevents this from earning a perfect score are the tracks ""Mr. President"" and ""Runner"".

Eye of the Tiger is an incredible album... and I've been raised on Rap, Punk and Hip-Hop. It hit me when I was watching Rocky IV, and when I heard it I googled it and saw the lyrics. I still read the lyrics. The song I googled was no less than: Eye of the Tiger! 5*!",1

"Not Helpful

Don't waste your money! This book filled with mistakes. In the elbow chapter, for example, the bony markings on the distal end of the humerus are either mislabeled or unlabeled. Descriptions or cancepts are often unclear and there are very few illustrations that would help to make them clear. I've relied more on other sources to study for exams and our proffesor is not using this book next semester because it is so horrible! I will not be keeping it as a reference source.",0
"very readable

It was interesting to follow a case study through all the chapters of the book. It provided a continuity that helped the reader identify with the family and concepts being presented. The author's voice is easy to understand and explains everything as he goes along, which is also another reason this book is a quick read. My favorite textbook for the class I'm taking!",1
"What a horrible movie

This was one of the worst movies I ever saw and I can't belive it won best picture. The dialogue was horrendous, the acting terrible, and the direction very basic.

"Rehash of Commonly Available Information

~Based on the title of this book, I expected to learn something surprising or ""ingenious"" about controlling ants. Instead, I found an introduction to ants with little style, and techniques of control that are easily (and more cheaply) found in articles on the web or in magazines -- techniques such as keeping your kitchen counters free of food, buying ant baits at the store, and hiring a professional when the invasion gets bad.The book notes that it's important to know the species of ants~~ in order to control them, but it fails to provide sufficient detail about each species to determine what type are in your home. The book also fails to distinguish between species in its recommendations for control.The text is scant and padded with similarly high-level (and thus not terribly useful) information about other pest insects.~",0

"The best bang for your bucks!

I've been using this Sony for recording church services for a couple years now. Obviously, this is not a high-tech operation. I convert the tape into digital format for editing on my PC to create CD's. I've been able to make some great tapes so far and I'm recording in a huge ""cathedral"" type church. For the size and cost, I think it's great. I don't think I'd use it for listening to music as the microphone is rather ""noisey"".

"Great CD

Being a huge Godsmack fan myself, I probably would be seen as biased. BUT I love this CD. To me, it is different from their other two. It's an older, grown-up sound and I would recommend this to anyone. It's hard to say which of the songs would be my favorite. I would say Serenity and Realign are my two most favorite ones, but I listen to this CD from start to finish. There's not one song on this CD that I skip over or don't like.Buy this CD! :) The only thing better than the CD's are their shows. You should check them out when they are in your town. They rock in concert!!!!",1
"VERY Disappointed!

Like another reviewer, I bought this book purely on the blind faith of the author's name. Patterson has not disappointed me in the past, but with ""Cradle and All"" he has: I read to the end ONLY because I expected it to get better and because I was at the beach and had no other book to read. Sorry I wasted the money on this one! I like the mystery quality of previous Patterson novels and was very disillusioned with the weirdness of this book. I don't like science fiction and don't like super natural stories and this had smackings of both. Mr. Patterson, stick to your Alex Cross stories and I am back with you!",0

It also had Kevin DuBrow singing in a better vocal range, darker and heavier than he'd ever done.Carlos' guitar work was excellent, energetic and meaningful.Overall, this little independent album re-energized the band and showed us that they were not has-beens, regardless of Top-40 being used as a ruler.""Terrified"" even made it into a low budget horror film, being rather appropriate.This album was re-released under a different name.",1

I bought this book following a paper enthusing about some of its ideas in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (JBIS Jan/Feb 2005). Unfortunately, I have to agree with earlier reviewers who have highlighted a pedestrian writing style, implausible 'characterisation' and character motivation, and the unengaging 'by numbers' plot development.I abandoned the book at page 78 as unreadable, not something I do often.

Even in plot-driven stories, the characters have to be real and must be able to invoke empathy from the reader.",0

It's very seldom that a book both takes hold of your heart *and* guides you through metaphors to notice something about reality that had previously escaped you. 'Momo' is such a book. Set in a fantasy world that parallels what we would consider ideal, 'Momo' is the story of a special girl observeing and trying to cope with/battle against the slow and unnoticed appearance of an army of grey men -- intent on stealing the free time from all the people in her world. The effects of this time theft is clever and in a way haunting; the world begins to become modernized, looking more and more like our own. To give away any more then that would be to give away the plot; trust me, it's a wonderfull, wonderfull read for adults and kids alike. I rank it up there with C.S. Lewis's ""The Chronicals of Narnia"".",1

I loved Creed's first album with original members Mark Tremonti on guitar, Scott Stapp on Vocals, Brian Marshall on bass, and Scott Phillips on drums. However, after that album, I think Scott Stapp was given too much control over the direction of the music and it started to really suck with their second album, and their third was even worse. Then I hear they're getting Brian Marshall back and ditching Stapp, so I get all excited. I'm hoping that I'll get to hear Brian's grungy bass and Mark's powerful guitar riffs once again like in the days of 'My Own Prison' with such kick ass songs as Ode, Illusion, and Unforgiven. This Miles guy comes in trying to sound just like Scott, but worse. So needless to say, I think it sucks.",0

"Lost inches and gained strength

9-06-99 is my 14th day of being on the diet. After the initial weightloss which was mostly water as Atkins himself says will happen I have lost just a few pounds. However, I weight train with heavy weights with a personal trainer 4 times a week. Since muscle weighs more than fat I figure that is why scale wise I do not show a huge drop, but it has been about 7lbs. I have lost 2 inches on my upper thighs and 2 inches on my hips. I love this way of eating and going out with friends to eat has never been a problem. My favorite quick food is now egg, tuna or chicken salad with cheddar cheese wrapped in a lettuce leaf.Thanks Doc!",1

Harry Tsalas' Farewell to Alexandria is a very interesting book. It definitely described the eternal great city we once knew and loved.

"Challenging and enjoyable

Ms. Barton has written a thoroughly engaging and involving story. That it is her first novel makes it all the more remarkable! The narrative moves so seamlessly from one paradoxical episode to the next that I hardly noticed how my assumptions were being challenged. The testament is both innocent and wise, so the reader cannot help but share Yves' delight, sorrow, pride and wonder as he observes and records the marvelous events of his life. The other characters who inhabit the world of Mandragora are simultaneously bizarre and believable. Some very funny episodes balance the underlying seriousness of the novel's dilemma.As the novel moved toward what I understood to be the inevitable outcome, I became more and more reluctant for it to end. Despite the difficult choices she poses for her characters (and her readers), Ms. Barton has written a story that is easy and satisfying to read. I look forward with pleasure to her next novel!",1

"Horrible Cover

The cover (the thing you sleep on - not the bag) is like a rubber membrane and not a canvas or woven cloth. It doesn't have any strength and won't take any abuse without ripping. It might be OK for a spare bed in the house, but don't even think of taking it camping because it can't stand up to real wear. Even hauling it around in the car will probably damage it beyond use. I called the company to complain, they said I could get a new cover if they had one, but they don't have them and haven't had them for a year. So don't expect any customer support from Slumberjack. My recommendation is get a cot that advertises a cover with ripstop nylon or canvas. Don't buy this cot if you plan on using it.",0

"Worthless and One Sided

I'll give Michener 2 stars because his book makes for interesting reading. This book has several problems. The biggest problem this book has is that Michener is a native New Yorker, and is EXTREMELY biased. The only people whom get a word in are the violently anticommunists. Michener apparently didn't talk to people who didn't aid in the revolution. He was probably using very extreme cases in his ""study"" of the AVO. In short, this book is not history, and is anticommunist propaganda. If you want an account of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 don't read this book...I would refer you a REAL historian. The only real use that this book could be used for was to show how anticommunist the West...other than that it's a worthless, one sided account of a failed revolution.",0

So when I decided to finally update my antique, I read the reviews and decided to go with this Brother.The price was so good I got one for my daughter too.While it took over 10 days to get mine (not sure why it took so long) when it arrived I was instantaly amazed.It works beautifully, and so quite!

This book provides a clear history of the miracle rebirth of Israel and God's undeniable hand in the miracle. It also describes how crucial the role of the U.S. has been in Israel's rebirth.

The Church has become complacent about what the Bible says about Israel and the effects that supporting her or injuring her will have upon any nation of the world. Wake up Church!!",0
"Don't ! Just Rent it.

Very disappointing. If one's expecting a hot scene, you won't get it, not even a warm scene. Weak plot. The guy travels from the USA to Argentina after his lover, but he doesn't convince me. He doesn't seem to be neither in love nor suffering. He's always smirking. If one's after Sabato's toy, the scene is flash, forget it. It seems to me that, apart from very few movies, most of them suffers from a weakness in their plots, their direction, their acting. And they lack real love feeling, such as in ""Just a question of love"" (Fr), ""Later Days"" (although the main actor's acting is weak (the religious guy) ).",0

"Why is this in the horror movie category?

Musicals make me ill, and this one will try to put you in touch with your feminine side if you know what I mean! You should all be ashamed! This movie is so bad that when they released it in movie theaters, people started making jokes at the movie, and started doing ""slapstick"" responses to the movie. Eventually, this became the norm, and fans started calling it the ""rituals"" that you performed during the movie when you went and seen it. For example, when a certain line in the movie was said, everyone in the theater would run to the back wall and hit it with their hands as fast as they could. These ""rituals"" got so out of hand, it eventually became a cult. You had to go through an initiation if it was your first time seeing the movie. For example, singing the Oscar Myer song while bending over. So there you have it. A movie that was so bad, people actually had to interact with it in hopes of making it better. LAME! NOT HORROR! NO GORE!",0

I now own it on my kindle also. Just when you thought the book was slowing down it picks right back up again and takes off with some kind of excitment. Just so you know, part two (World Wtihout End)is just as awesome a read, and of course it finishes off where the first book ends.",1

Because of learning about this fact we cancelled that order and he refunded my money. How considerate of that person to be so honest. I consider the company that sold me In Harm's Way (Region 2) was really only interested in making money and, not caring about the customer. They should have been aware of the difference.

If you have a few of Lee's CD's already, this won't dissappoint either. The title track is played first. It starts out like a melodic call then the whole band joins in, a young looking Herbie Hancock is on hand on the piano. This is wonderful music for contemplation because each peice is at least six minutes long, giving one to meld into the improv and tap to the beckoning beat. It is never overdone, it's just right. It's also worth while to read the liner notes written by Bob Blumenthal in 1976. It's very informative and helps with your understanding on what it took to make this music. I appreciate it more so because, I am kinda new to classic jazz and loving it. Make this part of your growing Lee Morgan collection.",1

"Wasaaaabiiiii!

First thing to know about this product is that it isn't actually wasabi. Actual wasabi, known as hon-wasabi, comes from that lovely sinus-clearing wasabi plant, and should be grated right from the root much like ginger. It can be found in tube form as well, but that is much rarer.This little squeeze-tube, like the powder stuff, is just regular horseradish, mustard seed and some food coloring. It contains 0% of the actual wasabi plant, and the flavor is different from hon-wasabi, although similar.But it still works. For most recipes, using the expensive hon-wasabi would be a waste of money, and this imitation does the job just fine. I personally keep both kinds, hon-wasabi for when I am using it directly for sashimi and a tube of the old faithful S&B; for when I want to make wasabi-flavored dishes.It is too bad that it is so expensive, because this tube would go for about a dollar a pop in Japan, but that is the price of imports eh?",1

I found this book to be a beautiful and compelling read! The dynamic between the hostages and the terrorists, although at times unbelievable, is interesting and unique.

This has got to be the slowest starting novel in history. Something like the first 500 pages had me forcing myself to turn the pages. I thought the slow ""start"" would never end, though my friend assured me to have faith. He was right. The last couple hundred pages are awesome. I learned that this book has one of the most interesting characters ever created in literature: Anomander Rake. I do not say that lightly. For exposure to that character alone, this book is a must read. Moreover, the other books in the series are solid too. This is a good series to start; there is a book a year, all very good - get in on it, and you'll have a lifetime of books to read. The others start slow too, but they stay slow for less and less time as you move along. Overall, I recommend this book. But you have to be patient and be prepared to work hard. Very complicated plot. Only for serious, avid readers. If you have Danielle Steele on your shelf, look elsewhere.",1

After 3 waffle makers, and looking at new ones for the same price as this multi-function grill, I decided to go ahead. Amazing... I really like it. Bacon has never been easier to make. Steaks come out great. Waffles are perfect. I guess it's one of my most successful buys. I do wish it could lie flat so I could make pancakes.",0

"Skip this and get DePalma's original

Objectively, viewed in a vacuum, this movie probably deserves two stars, not just one. But it doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's a remake of Brian DePalma's first Hitchcockian thriller, and I cannot forgive the new version for being such a bland and pallid imitation of an original that was so full of energy, humor, and terrific cinematic invention. How could something so full of zest have been so tepidly remade? The new version is practically a scene-for-scene copy, but the makers apparently failed to understand ANYTHING that made the original work. For A) creepy shocks, thrills, laughs, and suspense; B) racial, sexual, and political overtones completely lacking in the remake; C) Bernard Herrmann's superb music; and D) the BEST use of split-screen you have ever seen in your life (excepting maybe only DePalma's own CARRIE, which also suffered an inexcusably lifeless remake in this century), go with the original:Sisters: The Criterion Collection",0

This is a decent sipper. It fits nicely, sits a litter bit lower than preferred. I have two Nalgene 32 oz. Wide Mouth bottles, one with this sipper and one with the Guyot Designs SplashGuard. I have found that this Nalgene sipper tends to splash significantly more than the Guyot designs one. It works if you're driving, or if you actually stop moving and drink from it, but if you are still moving it is nearly hopeless. The Guyot designs splashguard can be sipped from even while jogging without spilling.",0
"Meandering and juvenile

Maybe this is one of those books that can only be enjoyed by young adult readers. No longer fitting that category, perhaps I just couldn't relate to a light-hearted tale about nothing of substance.On the plus side, this book contains no gratuitous sex or four-letter words. I can appreciate that. But, try as I might, I couldn't bring myself to appreciate the air-headed protagonist, her ditzy, controlling mother or, really, anyone else in the book. The entire novel felt like attending a dinner party only to end up stuck next to a guest who rattles on all night about the soporific irrelevant. Others praised it, but to me, the humor felt strained--as if, page after page, the author was trying way too hard to be clever. (And what was it with the shameless plugs for the author's musician/husband?)May be just the kind of book a career pageant-chick would find scintillating. But it did nothing for me.",0

These products are the biggest scam ever. They make it seem so easy in 'Meet the Fockers.'

On top of that, whenever you have to go back a stage, you have to buy a new system, due to the fact that you have to cut out the bottom as they progress in stages.

Intrigued, I looked up my sister Katherine (""KTH"" names), and it was again virtually 100% accurate. So I looked up my ex-girlfriend's name, and I was floored as I read an amazing page-long description -- as though the authors had followed her around and wrote about her temperament and beliefs.I highly recommend you check it out...

Start out by saying I'm a big Linkin Park fan. Hybrid Theory was amazing. Reanimation was cool. Meteora good. Hell even the mash-up with Jay-Z was good. Then this. What happened? The whole idea is the combination of rap & rock, and on this CD there isn't a single song that includes both... It's like they trade off songs... Also, as if slowing and quieting all the songs down wasn't enough of a deviation from prior albums they decide they need to venture into politics and rip the President in consecutive songs... Is there really any value in a song that refers to Bush as stuttering and mumbling... he'll be out of office soon, who will want to listen back on this and think, yeah, he's right....Best song on the CD is the single, What I've Done. No surprise there. The live version of What I've Done sounds the exact same as the studio one... All in all the CD did not meet my expectations.",0

I decided to leave this after reading a few reviews of this SPOOF of Bond. People are actually upset that someone dared to make fun of James Bond. Give me a break how seriously can we take it after Timothy Dalton played 007 ?The history given in one review does lead you to believe some of this movie was playing ""catch-up"" and no it's not hilarious but definitely funny and as someone who has seen every commercially successful Bond including R.Moore, S.Connery , T. Dalton, P. Brosnan and G. Lazenby this is funny. You can definitely see ""Austin Powers"" in it as well as a few other movies, but one must keep in mind this is british humor so you won't be slapping your knee or falling off the sofa.Frankly, I have more of an issue with Daniel Craig playing the early Bond instead of some younger Brit, but he was excellent in ""Layer Cake"" so I guess we'll give him a chance although not thrilled with Eva Green as Vespa Lynd, she's no Ursula Andress.",1
"You're not singing

Ashlee Simpson could possibly have talent to be a REAL singer, but there is no way she is rock. Rock is more than screaming and wearing dark colors. Beyond her persona... She actually had a hand in writing the tracks on her disc, the problem is that the lyrics blow. The music is cheesy, similar, and blows, and I regret spending $15 on it. The only semi-good songs on the disc are the first 4 then the rest of the disc is droning. She is interesting, She is adorable, She doesn't deserve to have a record contract. The guy on her show even said,""You're not singing on these tracks,"" but they put the songs on the disc anyway. What is that? Well anyway, I give the girl her props for selling that crap like hot cakes. This goes to show that POP CULTURE MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.",0

This book is very insiteful; it paints a beautiful portrait of the guilded age in New York. I especially liked her humor when she wrote that society thought having a ballroom in your home dedicated to only dances was wasteful, but it was very good if it could also be used for something else. The book really invites you into pre-WWI, pre-Titanic society. Whorton also points out some valuable lessons such as how good liars explain things but really great liars explain nothing. (More or less) Her vocabulary is also a plus; I needed a dictionary about twice in every chapter, but it was very fulfilling. My favorite ""new"" word is ""confabulation."" From now on, when my grandmother makes up sunny personal history, I shall compliment her unrivaled ability to confabulate. :) Very worth the time it takes to read.",1

This covers greetings, being kind and courteous, apologizing, and saying goodbye (and a lot in between). I read this book daily to my daughter and when she forgets to say the words anytime in the day, I remind her what Madeline would say. The French words (just a couple) also help to make it interesting and fun. The book is easy to read and has a rhyming scheme to it so it sticks. I really recommend this book to any parent. It is just wonderful.",1

The original plot line had humor and personal drama, this not so much and I'm wondering if I should bother continuing on with it.So, if you start reading this because you like Brian K.

"Choose another hockey game instead

As much as I wanted to really like this game, I just can't. Although we own NHL Hitz and NHL 2004, the primary reason we bought this game is because it allows you to create a player and, with the Eye Toy camera for PlayStation 2, put your very own face on it. That's the idea, anyway. In reality the player looked no more like my son or me than did any of the actual HNL players built into the game. So, in the end it is a feature with no actual benefit. Maybe that's because of poor product design or maybe it's the result of the limitations of the camera, but either way the game is not worth buying because the hockey action is so far behind the competing games. The graphics pale in comparison to either of the other games I mentioned, and the gameplay itself just isn't as fun or as realistic. Gretzky 2005 sounds great, but unfortunately isn't.",0

Bore little children, whose parents thought they were bringing their kids to a quality family movie. Love story? Oh, yes, children really like a love story between two robotic personalities who don't talk. Lastly, everyone has got to be attracted to a film with fat people floating around, being too lazy to care for themselves. Ah, that captain figure was really something. What ever happened to Wall-E during that detour? What a sad waste of Walt Disney/Pixar talent!",0

I get this for a family member who has multiple medical issues, including a liver problem. Taking medications for other things creates a burden on his liver as it tries to metabolize other medications and toxins from his diet (which he doesn't altogether avoid as he should). He will always use LiverCare as long as he can afford it, and he believes this product to be well worth the cost. He says he'd highly recommend it.",1

I love classical crossover music, and I'm afraid that I can't exactly identify why I like Josh Groban so much except for his voice! :-) This CD is great for studying and reading.

I bought Goodfellas on DVD yesterday at a local major chain store yesterday - I would greatly appreciate it they if you would let people know that the DVD only has HALF the movie on each side - I know this is Warner Brothers' (and I e-mailed them about it) doing but I'm kinda annoyed that a DVD would split the movie in half and I would have to stop and turn it over like some old record album. Also, given the cheesy cases, maybe Warner Brothers DVD's should be sold but not given any promotional space since after my last WB purchase I'm not likely to buy any more DVD's for a while and when I do I don't think I'll be buying any WB issues.",0

I ordered this book based on the rave reviews it gets here, and elsewhere. I was looking forward to reading it, thinking it was going to help me improve my photography, master difficult lighting etc. So, when it arrived, I eagerly unpacked it, sat down to read and ... err, is that it?Essentially it is a very basic beginners book. Probably for beginners its fine, but once you've figured out the elements of depth of field, and the idea that metering will not provide the optimum exposure in all cases, there's not much else.If you're new to photography, take a look. If you've read any other books, or taken a few rolls of film, look elsewhere.",0
"QUALITY ALBUM

This is basically a bootleg CD, put out by Death Row while Tha Dogg Pound was officially off of the label. It is tracks that had been previously recorded in the Death Row vault and Suge Knight put this album out to anger Daz and Kurupt and also make a little cash off of them. Overall, since it is official Dogg Pound made music (other than a lot of the beats), it is still a good CD. The only flaw is if you own a lot of Dogg Pound related music (Daz Dillinger, Soopafly CD's) you will hear some recycled tracks that are on other CD's. 5-6 tracks are on other albums, but other than that, it is worth the money and a good majority of the tracks are bangin'.

"Not recommended for aggressive chewers

These pressed rawhides are NOT recommended for aggressive chewers. I have a bulldog that loves to chew...and pressed rawhides have proven to be great for him. He would go through a typical rawhide bone in a few hours, and normal pressed rawhides will last him days.Not these though. After an hour or so of chewing the layers split apart, making the bone shrink dramatically in size AND creating a choking hazard for the dogs. These bones will last an average of 3 hours. We bought 25 of them thinking they would last us at least a month, and he was through them in a couple of weeks, with us having to throw out most of them because they split into pieces.We have one vendor that we usually purchase these from, but they were on backorder at the time and Simon needed his bones! That's why bought them elsewhere. Never again though. Now I know that not all pressed rawhide is the same!",0

"Great Game, BUT WAY TOO SHORT!!!

ok they promised so much in this game and didnt deliver.First off, they said that the game would cover the lifespan of 6-65 years old. This only applies if you stay in jail over and over until you are old. Battle scars? well i never got any.Hundreds of character possiblilites as far as looks, well not really. you can either have a bald head, short hair or medium hair. a beard or no beard and a very few small choices of mustache and goatee. The game is pain fully short and you will beat in within a week if youa re going slow.the armor types arent that different, there are only a few kinds of armor in the game and there is no advantage to any of them except Armor class. if you find a cool magicians robe, it will suck compared to plate armor and will offer NO advantage for a magic using character.It is a good game but come on, they promised all this freedom in the game and made us wait for it.

Yet another carbon-copy Man Or Astroman album. This band is quite prolific, and this album, while certainly not a bad one, will suffice as the MoA album of your choice. The band can play with a lot of energy, and they've always been tight, but the pitfalls still exist: lack of variety in tempos and keys, the one-song-represents-the-whole stigma, and of course, the pretentious TV-spacemen schtick, which is getting pretty old at this point. I would suggest, as an alternative, Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet, a Canadian instrumental/surf band with far more variety, whose creativity is stronger on the musical side, rather than the image. Not a bad record, this one, albeit generic, been done before, and been done better.",0

Okay you know how you read romance books and they will have a little bit more going on to support the romance. Like some kind of mystery or something.

While I like the characters and even the H/h of Nikolas as Paige I really didn't think the story focused much on them. Seemed like they were hardly together. Yeah they knew each other before and Paige spent time remembering that but really there wasn't much interaction between the two to warrant a romance. It just didn't feel like a romance novel.",0

But after 15-20 minutes, the shower was beginning to overflow and the clog did not go away.

"Really Good Bra for Smooth Look

I looked for a long time to try to find an underwire ""t-shirt"" bra - a bra that will give a smooth line under thin or clingy fabrics - but it was very difficult because most t-shirt bras only go up to a 38DD (I'm a 42DDD). This Wacoal bra fits the bill! It comes in larger sizes, the cup has no seams, the fabric is smooth but supportive (i.e. not too flimsy) giving a nice clean look to fitted shirts, and it's pretty - not industrial looking like many full sized bras. For my taste it's also not cut too high - I've had trouble with other full sized bras having a very high cut so that wearing a v-neck or low scoop-neck shirt was out of the question because the top of the bra would show. I find the bra very comfortable to wear and it could also be used for very low impact exercise (i.e. walking).

This is a book written by a sheepherder, designed specifically to keep his flock neat, happy and blind as a bat. It has literally no value in the real world and in fact does more damage than good, as it does little more than bring religion closer to the reader and make it that much more difficult to separate from the world we live in, which is secular by word of the Constitution.

Sonic is a game that you should only rent. I've played a good handfull of PS3 games, such as resistance, madden, need for speed and tony hawk and none of these games were as hard as sonic is to master. I do not like the gameplay at all, text boxes get in the way, there are more than one action assigned to a certain control and sometimes the game freezes my playstation 3. There are many problems wrong with the Sonic game and i could probably go on. Half the time you don't even control sonic and he will fall off the track. SEGA should have spent a lot more time perfecting this game. The graphics, however, are a nice feature... state of the art graphics and the enemies are beatable. Those are the only two things I like about sonic. I stood it out and beat the game but it was hard. Final verdict- the game is a good game if you like to get mad because sonic won't do what you tell him to do. I've played a lot of PS3 games and this is by far the worst, besides marvel alliance.",0

"Very loud!

This play has a plot that is just ok in my opinion. I watched it three times because I really thought it was just too loud at first. So I guess I will say this, if you are used to a lot of high powered, over singing gospel singers who are portraying their claim to fame on the camera....this will be a great play for you and you will enjoy it. I personally missed out on the theme of it because of all of the over dramatic actors in it. I like David Talbert's work however this one needs to be made over.

Some have described Peretti's writing as a cross between C.S. Lewis and Stephen King. Maybe so, but he's not nearly as good a writer as either of them.

"Entertaining classical pieces for music lovers

Classical music can be most entertaining outside big concert halls. I've once enjoyed a very intimate live performance of this Terzetto concertante for a small audience, and finally found it on cd. Those who are already familiar with Paganini's works for guitar and violin will certainly love this music, those who only know Paganini's concertos or capriccios should learn this musical side of his. Here is much more than the acrobatic Paganini, here will be found the creative process of his composing, pleasant elegancy and melodic singing quality.",1

This book is two things, I think: a brief Cheney bio and an expose of what has to be the worst-kept secret in American political history. In fact, as Nichols suggests, I'm not even sure that they WANT to keep it a secret.What people might not be aware of is Cheney's extensive history of amoral powergrabbing and immoral policymaking, and Nichols assembles the essential evidence in the case against Cheney in a reasonably compelling way. These days, there's an ocean of books to read about the Bush administration, and rightly so. This one might not be at the very top of the list in terms of fresh insights, but it is quick and worthwhile reading.",1

"Changed my LIFE!

When my oldest son was born, I wanted to go off somewhere and hide to give birth to him...like a cat. I reasoned, ""Women have been doing this for millenia, why can't I?"" My mother and my husband freaked out completely and found me a midwife. Okay, so no hospital and no doctor, maybe this will be alright. And I'm sure most people would have thought it was a beautiful birth. I felt robbed of my power, and disconnected from my body. Several years later I read this book. I still wasn't sure, but it had planted a seed. When I found a group of women online who were giving birth without medical (s)caregivers, I joined them, I learned to trust my body. When my second son was finally conceived, I had a beautiful, perfectly normal, unassisted pregnancy and birth. Even more importantly, my views on birth have affected EVERY level of my life.

These materials include painted papers, Japanese papers, found objects, photographs, etc.Rather than a how-to book, this is a book that presents many finished pieces in all their beauty, and explains how they were done by these very accomplished artists.

Then after a week or so it just turned of while I was using it and I haven't been able to get it to work again since then.

Admittedly, I've never been a huge Gwen Stefani fan, but her music (and No Doubt's) was at least listenable.

So, when she appeared on SNL last week, I thought, ""Well, I guess I can wait until the commercial break to go to the bathroom."" Mistake. Big mistake. I, too, am unable to explain my feelings about her performance of ""Wind It Up"" (and a quick listen to the album version didn't really clear things up for me). It's almost as if she and Fergie are playing some sort of crappy music poker, and Gwen has just upped the ante.

"An Awesome Resource for Cost Cutting...

I worked in restaurants where I felt unappreciated. I pledged to not cut corners in making my staff feel valued in my own establishment. That seemed impossible once I looked at my bottom line. This book reminded me that cutting labor costs could lead to costlier recruiting expenses once my staff flees looking for other work. A simple improvement, such as outsourcing payroll to an online service, is convenient and saves money. I also learned that making my restaurant a safe and enjoyable environment is an act of employee retention. Encouraging my staff, or playing their favorite music in the kitchen, goes a long way in reducing turnover. Even the worst bosses start off with the best intentions. They eventually become so focused on the bottom line that they do not notice their staff's morale. This book shows you how to keep both in sight.",1

I love these headphones. They're light and cheap and sound great. The bass frequencies come through extremely competently. But from my experience they're also unreliable.

I thought I'd just bought a dud or accidentally yanked a wire or something, and I ordered another pair. These lasted about two months until the speaker in one of the phones apparently blew. Now I hear a crackle with bass frequencies in that ear. It costs nearly half the price of the headphones to send them to Koss for repair, and factoring in shipping and repair time, it would be easier to just buy another new pair from Amazon and have them at your door in a week.

O'Murchu claims to have reached a synthesis of religion and science, including the ""new physics"" of quantum mechanics (hence the title). This is an interesting idea, but the author of a book such as this needs to have background in both physics and theology, and O'Murchu has little to say about classical theology and no knowledge of any kind of science. The list of scientists he has consulted is impressive (including David Bohm, Stephen Hawking, and Paul Davies), but it would appear that he threw out everything they told him; the book is filled with misinformation and outright lies about quantum mechanics. Beyond this, O'Murchu constantly invokes ""energy fields"" and ""forces"" all of which are undocumented in science but factor heavily in New Age type beliefs.

I suspect this is a fraud and that it was written to cause hatred of the subject instead of sympathy or empathy, and with a form of transparent child-psychology.

When John plays, it's an exploration of the instrument, he's riding it and seeing where it goes. Dave Navarro has a more disciplined style, so instead of riding, he drives his guitar exactly where he wants it to go. The music in this album is more precise, more calculated, and just as good as any other Pepper's album, if not a bit better be being a breath of fresh air.

However, the audio quality isn't that great, overemphasis on the bass which sounds pretty muddy. It's pretty bad with the noise cancellation turned off, and becomes average with it on. My iPod earbuds sound much better actually.In the end if given another chance I probably would buy a different pair of noise cancelling headphones to get something with better sound.",0
"Good story, poorly written, in dire need of an editor

What could have been an exciting three generation story of three actresses is hampered by too much useless detail and too many cliches. A good editor could have made this story much more readable and praiseworthy. I was attracted to the book because of its settings in Hollywood and Israel. I finished the book because of the story line.",0
"Great movie - But buy Sword of Xanten UK version, not this one!

This is a great movie but it is cut. The full version at 177 min is not available for NTSC format players yet. Go over to Amazon.co.uk and pick up ""Sword of Xanten"" for $10. You'll get all 177 min of footage plus some bonus material on 2 DVDs. Yes PAL format won't work on American DVD players but if you know what to do this won't be a problem.",0
"Plenty of gossip; little philosophy

Well, Strathern is certainly entertaining, if not informative. He gives us the dirt on each philosopher, tells us who was overweight, ... pushed people around, etc. This would be great if we were reading about movie stars or politicians but I bought these books in order to understand something about what these philosophers thought. He does reserve a few pages at the end of each volume to tells us one or two of their ideas and gives us a handful of quotes. A total waste of money unless you hate your philosophy classes so much that you want to hear how awful the personal lives of the philosophers were. A new low in publishing.",0
"Covers good fundamentals, good pictures

Covers good fundamentals, good pictures breaking down proper sequences, and good drills. More focused towards high school players.",1
"Slippery

I bought this mat after reading all the good reviews. Washed it with a little soap and air-dried for a week to get rid of the smell. On my first use, I was sliding every time on downward dog and on standing poses. So much so I had to change to the gym's mat in order to continue with the class. I am disappointed with this purchase.",0
"Too basic

This book is a very thin overview of the Web development process. It takes around 30 minutes to read. It is very basic material, likely only relevant to people who have never done any Web development work before. Although I question the value of spending money on any basic overview books, I would recommend The Elements of User Experience over this one.",0
"I love these sandals

This is my second pair of these Skechers Sandals. The first pair would still be around if my dog didn't think they were a chew toy.

"A Popular and Readable Science Book

The book is very interesting, and it will surprise no one who is involved in science that Dr. Gordon specializes in one species of ant, not the elusive 'ants in general'. Her 17 years of observation of one species in one location makes her research particularly compelling. Some readers will be better served, or at least more satisfied, with Wiki and YouTube, or books specifically written for younger audiences. But for non-entomologist adults, this is a delightful read.",1
"Do not be fooled!

The ingredient list they have here is not correct. This shampoo is by no means all natural or herbal: Sodium Laureth Sulfate and alcohol are listed as the main ingredients, with olive oil and coconut oil being at the bottom of the list (unlike their listing which puts the olive oil at the top). It is nothing but regular shampoo. The way it is listed gave me the impression that I was getting an oil based shampoo that would moisturize my hair. I wouldn't buy any of these products.",0
"It deserves a zero

I had an older version on my Mac computer that worked with an older version of OSX. When I bought my new iMac it had Tiger installed, and all of the sudden my Norton would not work. I tried to upgrade since what I read on the website said it would work, but I was wrong. The web site was very confusing, maybe I should have called first. Norton needs to come clean and put disclaimers everywhere. Waste of money.",0
"""Traditional Catholic Hymns""?

Why is this ""Traditional"" CD full of songs produced in the last 40 years? (a mere second in the life of the Church, young grasshopper ;-) ) Frankly, liturgical music has been has been in a pretty sorry state for the last few decades. ""On Eagle's Wings"" isn't as theologically dubious as some of the other songs I've suffered through at Mass, but the words aren't exactly INSPIRED, and the melody sounds like a rather unsubtle score for a melodramatic moment in a movie. And why make the situation worse by rendering songs in jazz and rap styles, among others? It MATTERS what style music is played in, and twisting music like this just for the sake of novelty is not nessesarily good for worship. What's next, ""Death Metal Mass, to be sung by KISS""?Anyway, I'm kinda sad they didn't put ""Faith of Our Fathers"" or ""Holy God We Praise Thy Name"" on here... Not to mention the Tantum Ergo, Pange Lingua, Vexilla Regis, etc. Sigh...",0
"Not so great an album

I expected better for the follow-up to Head-On. That album has some good stuff on it, but Freeways was a letdown. Randy experimented with a different sound, more mellow, less thunder, and the music suffered greatly. I continued purchasing albums from these guys, but my expectations were shattered. If you are a serious collector of BTO, then this album is a must. If you are looking for a sound to identify with the late 70's, this ain't it.",0
"Well worth the wait!

This fantastic CD is proof that we need great talent showcases like ""American Idol"" on TV today; such shows remind me of ""The Original Amateur Hour,"" which was one of the top shows of the day when I was growing up.Kelly truly lives up to that title through every track...and there's something for every taste here, from ballads to smooth jazz, to uptempo pop (check out her duet with Tamyra).The other reviewers have said all there is to say, but I'd like to add my own two cents here...it has earned every inch of the #1 ranking in Billboard. Congratulations!",1

"More emphasis need on education, being formal or financial

The author, while he does suggest education is important, does not stress it - he suggests advanced education is important only if you are entering into a professional career. (Read the introduction to see what I mean) - You may want to speak to the your children on that, I felt a bit uncomfortable knowing that's what my chilren would be reading.It was just 2 paragraphs. Maybe I am sensitive to education and what it means, but I certainly don't want to give anyone `permission' to not study. Formal education or financial education both take time and effort, nothing comes easy.All else was golden, especially hearing it as young people. As in all things, we take what is good, and leave the rest.",1

"A MUST read!

This book was great... I can see why major companies like AT&T, Proctor & Gambel, Pfizer, and others gave it to their employees. I even had my 11 year old son read it!!Whether you're content or unsettled in your career life or personal life, this book is helpful.It's a shame there was a poor review. The writer seemed to have pigeon holed it as an Amway book. I consider the successful people/companies that have read it and follow their reviews... it's not #1 for nothing!!",1
"the last two songs are good else keep going try nuggets 2

my personal opion is that this does not define a great set of psychedelic music rather a misrepresentatin of bad 50's cut's like stuff buddy holly would have left on the floor however the last two songs are worth there money. perhaps if amazon allows you should download those songs. else keep going if your looking for psychedelic music. my suggestions are nuggets 2, the deep six, the essential pebbles and the yankee dollar or whale feather.",0
"Awesome Book!

This is an awesome book! It spans a 100 year time frame and does a good job of mixing in relevant pieces of real history. If the main character in this book (Rose Dunmore) is not someone in the authors family than she has an incredibly creative mind. I really enjoyed the spiritual Bible references and the good ole' fashioned down-home common sense that Rosa dished out in abundance. The authentic language was also a nice touch. Bravo, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it for a book club read! -ES",1
"Strange but good

I have been waiting for months for the day this cd would come out, and I am not too disappoited with it. Bye Bye Bye, It's Gonna Be Me, and This I Promise You, I already heard and loved (o yeah, Max Martin rocks). But most of the other songs (with the exception of ""It Makes Me Ill"", ""Space Cowboy"", and ""No Strings Attached"") are just strange, not *NSYNC music at all. I don't know what JC was thinking when we wrote alot of the rest of songs. warn you: If you like ""Bye Bye Bye"", it doesn't mean that you will like the rest of the songs. (o yeah, Kristian Lundin rulez)! Not prefrct, but pretty nice.",1

Not happy at all. Delivery time was excellent, very fast.",0

"Being BAD is GOOD!

What a fun book! This is an anthology of 3 novellas about agents in B.A.D. (The Bureau of American Defense), a C.I.A. clone of sorts, based in Nashville. The first novella was a tad clichéd in plot, but the other two were a scream, especially the last one. Kenyon has a wicked sense of humor, making me laugh out loud over and over again. No kidding. Snappy dialogue, great sex scenes, fun characters. This book was an absolute delight.",1

"Where are the statistics that validate the author's claims?

If one is a successful church consultant, records speak for themselves. What was the attendance when the author assumed his relationship with the Southern Pennsylvania church? What is the same question for when he discontinued his services? Finally, the author would do will to authenticate his thesis by telling the reader the current statistics of the church following the period since his intervention. The question is not that churchs experience difficulty. The important issue is what was the specific plan of action initiated by the author and how did that plan produce symbols of sustainable recovery?

"A real ho-hummer, unfortunately

About half-way through this book, I realized I didn't really care who did it. Or why. Or about any of the characters in the plot-line other than our regulars -- Alex, Milo, and Robin. I think the initial plot device, a vague deathbed confession from an unlikely murderer, was a good idea. The rest of the plot was a hot mess, involving characters discussed, but never really ""present"" in the book. I have loved many of Jonathan Kellerman's books, but this one didn't deliver.",0
"What a bore!

I'm sorry...but seriously...this book just bored me to tears. I understand how important this book is for young lesbian teens who feel confused, lost, alone, etc. on their feelings about other girls...but i couldn't get past most chapters without just feeling bored to tears. I felt like the whole story was so wooden, the characters are not interesting, and the way they talk and react with one another is just not realistic to me, its just...well, a bit too flowery and trying too hard to be poetic and deep. I don't clearly understand why they have this chemistry either...I just don't understand the hype surrounded by this book. Lesbian lovers, great! But that alone doesnt necessarily make a good story.",0
"Cherie L. Arnold

"More Gritty, Less Barry

Dave Barry writes another book in the bunch-of-nuts-in-South-Florida genre.While his first book, ""Big Trouble"" felt like Dave Barry nuttiness put together into a workable plot, this book feels more like a good crime plot with Dave Barry nuttiness added.That may imply that the book is not funny. Not true. It's very funny in spots, especially when dealing with the characters who describe themselves as living at the ""Old Farts Dying Senile Center"".I've noticed that since 9/11, Dave Barry's columns have become slightly less wacky and a bit more heartfelt. In some ways Tricky Business reflects this shift.Overall I'd say Big Trouble was slightly better, but that's because I like laughs better than violence. Tricky Business is grittier, more violent and may appeal to those who like their stuff a bit more ""real"". On its own, it's a great read and compares favorably to other books in the genre (e.g. those by Elmore Leonard).",1

I did like the quality of the still pictures, much improved over my GRDVL510.The 510 has not been without problems ....frequent head cleaning notices.. not to mention the pixelated images. I was using JVC tapes and was advised by JVC to switch brands ...now using Sony..so far ..so good.I have to say my 8 year old Sony 8mm handycam still works and has never required a head cleaning.

"Cute, but smelly!

If this is the same as the pad we have, it has an herbal-type scent which turns into a very bad odor when heated.

"Good read with plenty of detail information regarding security systems.

What I liked about this book is that its detailed and has good current and historical information about the security industry. Some of the information about detection devices is out dated but it gives you a good perspective on what the past trends in the security industry was like. Now items like glass break detectors and PIR and dual sensors are a main stay in the industry. I purchased this book for the Florida state alarm exam along with a bunch of other books. I took the online prep course with Steve Dale at Power Learning Systems. That helped a lot. I don't believe I would have passed this very hard exam without taking this course. Also, you need to get all the state approved reference books because the exam questions are from every book that is listed on the state website.",1
"Malo - Rocks the Rockies

Malo Rocks the Rockies, is a live album that really moves you. The sound is great except when they recorded it, they didn't remove the feedback from the microphones on a few of the song tracks.

I highly recommend this CD to everyone that likes Malo............>> Steve Stenlake",1

"I'd give it half a star if I could

As a big fan of the Ashes series, I've been disappointed of late with the last few books. Other reviewers have said that Mr. Johnstone is dead. I don't know if that is a fact or not. What I do know is that this book absolutely sucks. Poorly edited. No real plot. Survive plague, drive around, find dog, kill bad guys, find and fall in love with incredibly hot woman, kill more bad guys, girl gets kidnapped, hunt down kidnappers, kill them, and oh yeah, a big plot twist, this time the hero isn't quite in time, and the girl gets horribly disfigured. Those are the good points of the book. In an attempt to tie into the Ashes series, the new hero was with Raines when he died, and there are some Rebels left. However, there are no longer any women in the Rebel army, AND the timeline has been completely rewritten. The only positive thing to come out of this for was that I bought this waste of perfectly good paper USED!",0

It tells the story of how these kids face discrimination from their peers and family. Their stories are mixed in with artists renditions of songs from Hedwig. Some of which are not very good.

"YOU DONT NEED TO RELATE TO A STORY TO ENJOY IT

I was surprised to see the last review. The reader did not like the writing because she was not young enough to appreciate it. If someone needs to relate to this story in order to appreciate it, they are missing the best thing about this book.This book lets you look at the world through the eyes of a lunatic. To see his warped views and the reactions of people around him from HIS standpoint. The goal of the read does not seem to earn sympathy for the guy or understand teenagers; its purpose seems to be pure entertainment.... or maybe some understanding when you meet a crazy person.If you have a good sense of humor, you can pick up this book and start reading from any paragraph and start laughing in seconds. Unless of course if simple-minded cynicism offends you... in which case you would fail to meet the former requirement anyway.",1

"Inside the birth of The New Yorker and Algonquin Round Table

Jane Grant is the un-sung hero of The New Yorker. It was Grant -- wife of editor Harold W. Ross -- who pushed him to get the magazine off the ground. In this amazing book, it tells how she met and married the man, but this is just the beginning of the partnership. It tells of the roots of the Round Table -- which were in Paris, where Grant was stationed with the Americans (as a singer). Grant is a wonderful writer with an eye for detail. It has first-hand stories about life with Ross, Alexander Woollcott, Dorothy Parker and the others. The introduction is by her clsoe friend, Janet Flanner. It was Flanner in her ""Letter From Paris"" that helped usher in a new kind of journalism. It was Grant who brought Flanner to Ross' attention. The rest, as they say, is history. If you love The New Yorker, you'll treasure this book. Many archival photos too.",1

When I gave the pencil to my wife as a Christmas present, she was thrilled. She is an avid crossword puzzle fan. Once the lead ran out, we were unable to get the new lead in to the pen. $30 bucks out the window and what was a nice stocking gift turned in to a downer.",0
"A Big Disappointment

THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FRIENDLY INTRODUCTION TO ITALIAN, BUT I FOUND IT ANYTHING BUT THAT. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THE SMALL PRONUNCIATION GUIDE; IT APPEARS ONLY IN THE FRONT OF THE BOOK. IN MY OPINION, IT IS MUCH MORE HELPFUL TO HAVE A PHONETIC PRONUNCIATION BESIDE EACH WORD/PHRASE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO KEEP RETURNING TO THE FRONT OF THE BOOK. I CAN HIGHLY RECOMMEND BARRON'S ITALIAN AT A GLANCE; IT HAS AN EASY-TO-FOLLOW PRONUNCIATION GUIDE AS WELL AS PHONETIC TRANSCRIPTIONS FOR ALL WORDS AND PHRASES USED IN THE BOOK. TO SUMMARIZE, IF YOU HAVE NO OR VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF ITALIAN PRONUNCIATIONS, THIS GUIDE IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.",0

Excellent presentation of a piece of social history combined with graphic scenes from combat that bring home the futility and horror of war. Ken Burns method of personalizing it to 5 towns in the US was a masterstroke making it so much more real.",1
"Couldn't put it down

This is a superb read and Mr Mosely coveres an intensely complex period with majesty and skill. Here and there it is a bit difficult who the subject is of a sentence, as the relative pronoun sometimes doesn't come after the immediately preceding subject of a sentence, but that happens rarely. Mr Moseley's reads like a thriller, but at the same time is a thoroughly researched, critical reading of a tragic, through fascinating period of history. I cannot recommend this book more highly for anyone interested obviously in history, but also for those interested in human behviour and our ability to deceive and contradict ourselves. Do read!",1

"Sometimes entertaining but spiritually barren

There is perhaps no bigger waste of time than reading about spirituality from a journalist with little serious interest in his subject. I can't blame the author who admits in the title that he is just a ""tourist"" in the spiritual realm and I am not against some healthy skepticism in approaching this subject, but it seems to do this subject justice you must actually live, not just visit, the spiritual path with some sincerity for some time in order to recommend or criticize. Without a doubt some of the teachers and gurus he visits are easy marks for some cheap shots, but that's what they feel like -- cheap shots done for the sake of entertainment, not insightfulness. The amount of time spent on Theosophy and Mr.Creme is baffling given their relevant lack of importance today.",0

"Cheap and Flimsy

I got these sunshades because I used to have similar ones back in the 90's and I loved them. The accordion shade I have now is cumbersome to fold inside a small car (in this case a Honda Civic), and I remembered the little oval ones being easier to collapse. Plus, they fit in the pocket in the driver door - whereas the accordion type has to be maneuvered into the rear floorboard.The fabric in THESE shades is more like a type of tinfoil than fabric. Anywhere it wrinkles it creases and the metallic coating starts to flake away. Without the metallic coating, the screen blocks no light at all - making the shades increasingly ineffective. They should have skipped the metallic coating, used instead a thicker material - perhaps block out lining material like they use in curtains?Anyway - not worth the $$$, even at just $8. My $4 old accordion shade is more effective.",0
"No Olson=No Songwriting

If you're a fan of ""Hollywood Town Hall"" or ""Tomorrow the Green Grass"", as I am, you'll probably be very disappointed with ""Sound of Lies"". Gone are their trademark harmonies and catchy tunes. Instead of sticking with what they were best at, no-nonsense country rock, the band apparently chose to go in a whole new direction and ended up sounding like one of many very ordinary second-rate alternative bands. The absence of Mark Olson is very apparent, as the songwriting quality on this release is very poor..... It really bothers me to think what a great band they once were and how far they have fallen. Save your money for something you'll actually listen to more than once!",0

"a grand sweep of major inventions

If you like the style of a Scientific American issue, then you should check out this book. Their editors have amassed a chronicle of key inventions and discoveries, spanning the history of human civilisation. Some 400 inventions are explained. Albeit briefly, because of space considerations.The book tries to put these into a context of ever onward and upward. Though in the historical periods (especially antiquity), these inventions must have been repeatedly invented and forgotten.As an item of terminology - the ""inventions"" also include things which are arguably discoveries. Like the positron. It certainly existed in nature before physicists were aware of it. Though algebra might indeed be an invention, to some who would regard it as a pure construct of the mind. But others, especially some physicists, would pay that no heed; saying that such things exist independent of human consciousness.",1

Taking other reviews into consideration, I ordered this one size larger than usual and it fit my EE wide foot sized dad just perfectly.High cut keeps even ankles nice and toasty warm without having to wear socks.High cut also means it's not as easy to just slip on and off like normally cut house slippers, but unless you're frequently taking them on and off, it's not a big deal at all.Nice, solid soles make it fit and feel more like supportive house shoes, rather than sloppy, floppy house slippers.",1

I am a big Romantic suspense fan and I've been waiting for this book for a long time.Unfortunately, this book was very strong in military knowledge & action (which I love) but very light on romantic chemistry.

"Sounds bites don't do this CD justice!!

Hi all. I'm new to country music. This is only my third CD in the genre... and I liked the video (oh yeah, I'm also a new CMT addict); I thought I might like the CD. I wasn't sure after listening to some sound bites... I thought everything sounded the same, not really offering a good sample of music. But I found one used and cheap, so hey what the heck, I bought it. And it has NOT LEFT MY CD PLAYER SINCE! The songs are wonderful to listen to on a ""blah"" day -or even a good one, for that matter- before I knew it, I was singing along, out loud and off-key. I especially loved the two I was familiar with, ""Prayin"" and ""Everyday love""... but now I can't get enough of ""Long slow beautiful dance"". Beautiful, moving lyrics that are easy to relate to, and catchy tunes make this a staple in my (and I hope your!) cd player!",1

As stated in the title, this book contains the complete score for all 6 Brandenburg Concerti and all 4 Orchestral Suites by Bach. Parts are not included nor are they available separately from Dover.It is in modern notation with very clear, dark printing. It is a large-format (approx. 8 1/2 x 11) paperback book and is bound like most paperbacks.As with all Dover Editions, it is very easy to read and follow the music, but it was not designed as a performing score. Because of the binding (it won't lie flat) and because no attention was given to page turns, it is very difficult to play from. But if you wish to study the music or follow the score while listening to your favorite recording, you can't beat this edition for the money.",1
"Awful.

This book was terrible. I was told it was good so I started to read it, but I found I could barely finish it. I don't even read mystery books and I knew who the killer was in the first twenty pages. The ""heroine"" of this tale (I use this term very loosely) was boring and uninteresting and frankly also kind of easy. The other characters in the book weren't much better. None of them were developed past a name and physical description. The action sequences were bumbling and the subplot confusing. There were some good ideas in this book but the author never took the time or energy to develop them. It read like someone's leftover brain storming ideas thrown hastily together. Don't even bother with this book.",0

If this worked, it would be great. Unfortunately, it doesn't. Even with the unit placed on top of the radio (a high-end JVC -- some reviewers have mentioned that reception was dependent on the quality of the FM receiver), it was still filled with static, and sounded cheap (which admittedly, the iPod is).

It was fast-moving, entertaining, and we could see the development of the ""bad guy"" character that we know is evolving. I was sorry to see the movie end.

Just how does one combine the great Samuel L. Jackson, a crack team of commando police officers, and a villain willing to pay $100 million for freedom and make something as clunky as ""SWAT""? Well, if you want the answer to that question, this laborious ""action"" thriller is for you. As with most contemporary films, check your brain at the door; in fact, the only thing you'll really need it for is ticking off all of the other movies you'd rather be watching. Of course, you could also spend the time cataloging the many films this one seems to raid for ideas . . . ""Heat,"" ""Bad Boys,"" ""Licence to Kill,"" ""The Right Stuff,"" ""Executive Decision,""--not to the mention the 70s TV series upon which it is based. The story--an international gangster gets nabbed and the SWATsters battle former team members to keep him--is just a flimsy excuse for some ho-hum action sequences and lots of tiresome macho posturing.

I've tried to understand the positive reviews for this album - I've listened to it a number of times now, but I give up. I've been a fan of Cobain and Dougan's Future Sound Of London for ages - but this album is just plain brutally bad. Their ersatz psychedelia involves taking a musical cliché and piling on swirling layers of stuff, ad infinitum, with no respite - salted now and then with awkward lyrics delivered with a suprisingly amateurish bent... Is it a parody? As a joke, even then it might be interesting if it weren't also so terribly recorded - it sounds harsh and muddled.

But the baseplate is a deal-breaker, it flexes way too much, and is NOT square to the saw when set at zero, there about a 3 degree bevel backwards, so I have to set the saw at 3 and constantly re-check it.

For this purpose it is ideal: low cost; colour view sceen with sound; plays 8mm and Hi8 tapes; rugged and high quality feel, so it may last a long time; apparently the only name-brand 8mm camera available at this time.If you are looking for a general purpsose camcorder do not buy this one for the following reasons1. 8mm and Hi8 is obsolete. When your camcorder finally breaks (as all three of mine did after an average of 5 years use) you will have a hard time finding a device to playback your precious tapes on.2. This camcorder has no ""steady shot"" which in my experience is the most important feature for easy recording of good quality videos.3. This camcorder is rather big and heavy compared to many others available.Steven Woodward",0
"I am loving it!

This one is a winner. I havent put it to too much test because I am still waiting for my 32GB P2 cards. I had done a bit of testing with the FS-100 HD and had to return it double fast. If you want to fully enjoy the use of this camera, its best to go with the P2 cards, they are light-weight and dont have any moving parts. The FS-100s are clumsy, although a great idea, you could easily pull the firewire cord without realising it and waste several hours of valuable recording in the process.",1
"SO WHAT IF THEY SOUND LIKE INTERPOL?!!!

Interpol is my favorite band and the fact that Editors sound remotely like them does not bother me at all. Tom Smith has a voice reminiscent of Paul Banks and even Eddie Vedder at times, however he makes it his own. My favorite songs are ""Lights"", ""Munich"", ""Fall"", ""All Sparks"", ""Fingers in the Factories"", and ""Open Your Arms"". I'm going to San Francisco to see them at the end of April. I've heard they're amazing live and I don't doubt it one bit. I've heard San Diego radio stations playing ""Munich"" already and Rodney on the Roq in L.A plays it on his show sunday nights. The comparison will always exist, but any music lover should appreciate Editors! Oh, and by the way, it's Editors. Not THE Editors. Just Editors. I wonder why they didn't add THE. Maybe because it's not THE Interpol.",1

"Over hyped

Bought some Diamond 8.2's a few months back. After listening to them with all different types of music and also playing them to friends and family the response was rather negative. These speakershave a really boomy bass, at some points it was hard to distinguish other sounds over it. I tried turning it up and at points the vocal became disorted and shrill, it also sound very flat and 2 dimensional.When played at low, easy listening levels the musical details are lost by the silk dome tweeter and its overly tame driver.I dont use these any more as i have bought myself some Bose but i would not recommend them to anyone except those on a very tight budget who are not so fussy about sound quality.",0
"FINALLY!!

I would have given it 5 stars because I love this show and am excited Universal finally decided to release it, but I am disappointed that they are not including more special features or blooper reels, as great as the chemistry was between Scott and Dean, the bloopers had to be hilarious, such a shame that we are missing so much behind the scenes on this show! I am also disappointed that Universal doesn't seem to be interested in any reunion/wrap up movies. I will still buy all the seasons, because I loved the show, and miss it. Tamyshka",1

"just a rewrite of the manual

This is probably the worst technical book I have ever read. The author simply covers the commands of the software without any insight. There is a total lack of fluidity between the sections--each one seems to have been written by a different individual who doesn't care what was said before or will be covered later. Lots of boring repetition without purpose and very dry humor. If you still would like to buy one, BUY MINE.",0

As the title says -- I liked these stars. They are exactly what I was looking for and what you'd expect.

Now, sometimes I can see them a little, and sometimes not at all.",0

While this book certainly has a lot of good nuggets, it doesn't quite measure up to the ""gold standard"" of Vic Orenstein. Nonetheless, as an amateur child photographer who is trying to glean as much info as possible, I definitely got a lot out of Box's discussion of techniques. He basically presents 50 of his photos, and tells the ""story"" of how he shot each one, complete with lighting diagrams and how he interacted with the kids. Also very helpful is his resource section at the end which gives contact info for his favorite vendors of photo supplies and accessories.",1
"Unintentionally campy. Terrible writing.

Cusack has been in some so-so movies, but previously I would have given Freeman more credit than this. I hadn't read any reviews of this moving going in, but it quickly became clear the writing was aweful. This movie is bad: bad writing, unbelievable sequences, cliched characters, you name it. This movie reminded repeatedly me of those bad, low budget action movies you used to see a lot of in the 70's and early 80's - especially those made for TV. I did get a few kicks out of movie, but it was inevitably because the script was just so horrible. Did I mention the writing was aweful? Give it a pass.",0

Arter reading the book I felt that there were a lot of unanswered questions.I kept asking myself whatever happened to..?

But overall it was a good experience but I dout that I will ever raed it again",1
"Not the best buy I have ever made

This coffee pot looks nice and the coffee is great as soon as it finishes making. But the thermal carafe doesn't keep it hot very long, even though I let it stand with hot water in it before I made the coffee. The 2 thermal travel mugs are the same. And they are hard to drink out of without dribbling the coffee down the front of your shirt! Also, the travel mugs do not have anything to cover the hole on the top and it splashes out in your car. I have quit using this pot and gone back to my old one.",0
"Thoughtful Must Mean Boring

Harper's reminds me of a book reading I once went to. The author read a selection from Proust. It took forever and when she finally got to the 'point' the crowd all murmured and nodded in approval at its profundity. I thought I was going to go out of my mind.......what's so profound about taking 1000 words to make a point that could have been made in ten words or less? And therein lies my problem with Harper's.People here compare it with other ""thoughtful"" magazines like the Atlantic and the New Yorker. No....it's not like those magazines at all; every paragraph in those magazines is packed with information that is critical to understanding the entire story. They don't take the rambling ""blue highways"" approach like Harper's does. If you really want a magazine that is balanced and in depth without the wandering prose of Harper's try my two favorites: the New Yorker and the Economist. I also recommend the Atlantic.",0

""Only where there is disillusionment and depression and sorrow does happiness arise, without the despair of loss, there is no hope""(pp 334) - Wow, how deep!

"Awesome First RC!!!

My 18-month old is really enjoying playing with this radio-control truck. It is a great first RC toy. It has only 2 buttons and they are BIG so it is great for his little hands. The truck only goes forward and can spin around, NO reverse. He figured out how to make it go right out of the box. He watches his big brothers play with their RC cars and now he can join in too.Negative: it has a siren that turns on every time the truck moves and it is loud. I wish there was a on/off switch for the sound.Overall, a great first radio-control truck for a little one!Update (3/24/10): Came up with one more negative. If you have other RC vehicles you may have trouble with the frequencies overlapping. My older son's RC hummer remote also operates the fire truck so unfortunately the 2 kids cannot play with their RC trucks at the same time. If I could give 3 1/2 stars for this I would. Still a good first RC though.",1

"A Polish Jew, a Holocaust Survivor, Sets the Record Straight

Sigmund Gorson, a Polish Jew, has written an expose of the numerous historical inaccuracies in the film Shoah. Gorson's article can be found in the library of Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, CT. Among other things, Gorson points out that: 1) Two million Polish Christians were also murdered by the German Nazis during the Holocaust, 2) The Warsaw Ghetto uprising had far more extensive supply of arms by the Polish underground than the token one-gun shown in the movie, 3) The scene where uniformed Polish soldiers shot Jewish women and children is a vicious lie, 4) Overall, more Christians than Jews perished in the hands of the German and Austrian Nazis, 5) True instances of Polish collaboration with the Germans against the Jews were very rare, and were punished by death by the Polish underground, etc. So for those who think that Shoah presents gospel truth, I would advise them to read Gorson.",0

This was a beautiful book, capturing every reason why Sondheim's music is so brilliant.

If you really want to know what goes on in his head while he is composing his masterpieces then buy this book! Though it concentrates heavily on musical theory and sondheim's pieces from a composer's point of view, you do not need to be an expert in music theory to appreciate this book, because it is filled with exciting tidbits of everything you would ever want to know about his pieces. You also really get to know the man behind the music, and you get to see what his original manuscripts looked like!

"Fur Flies with FURminator!

Worth every penny! The fur really flies with the FURminator. I have worked in the veterinary field for 25 years and have used all types of brushes, combs and shedding blades. This is by far the best out there. It does an unbelievable job on cats and all my cats love it, even the one that hates to be brushed. It removed all the loose hair and dead coat from my Dalmatian. One word of caution...don't get over enthusiastic brushing over the same spot. Like most shedding/stripping blades the FURminator removes the undercoat and you can create thin/balding spots if you get too agressive.",1
"Misleading product

While the item shown and the description says it is a Holmes filter, what was shipped was a clone filter. It can work only if you pull the mounting clip of an old filter. While I suspect the filter will work, the vendor was certainly misleading in their description.",0
"Not As Described by Amazon

This Timex watch (model T45221) as described by Amazon: ""It features a large silver stainless steel watch case that's topped by a special grip bezel with black engraved elapsed time markings and coin-edged detailing for a sure grip in inclement conditions."" In fact, the case is plated brass (per my experience after purchasing this watch, and according to Timex's site) and the bezel is merely decorative with a smooth edge and it cannot be rotated or gripped well while I'm sitting at my desk, let alone in the field. One more thing: Amazon says this watch's bracelet has a safety clasp, and the site includes a link to a drawing showing the clasp. This, too, is inaccurate, for the bracelet has no safety clasp. It's a nice-looking watch, but I know from previous experience with brass-cased Timexs that it will corrode on my wrist in about a year. That's why I had hoped this one would be an upgrade, but it isn't. I'll be returning it.",0
"'The Searchers' - lite

Reading the premise you could be forgiven for thinking you were onto a winner here: Intriguing characters - sinister rogue Apache 'witch', tough independent frontier mother, estranged father who left to 'go native' - and a potentially engrossing story. But all ingredients sadly come to very little under Ron Howard's undercooked direction. Visually and dramatically the film compares very poorly in toughness, menace and visual power with 'The Searchers' on which it is clearly a riff, a decaffeinated, low-cal one at that.. Kate Blanchett gives a sturdy performance that deserved a better vehicle. Tommy Lee Jones by contrast looks ill-at-ease throughout. Of recent westerns, Kevin Costner's 'Open Range' takes up the reins of the tradition with far more satisfactory results.",0
"Come Back Tracey, Come Back

I am an extremely die hard fan of Everything But The Girl (E.B.T.G.) and knew early on there could never be a best of compilation that would satisfy me. The fact is that their first few albums were their best work-1. Eden (1984) 2. Everything But The Girl (1984) 3. Love Not Money (1985). If you want to know WHAT they sounded like before they sold out, these 3 albums are a good place to start. If you want to hear HOW they sounded at their peak- get these 2 albums: 1. Idlewild (1988) 2. Acoustic (1992). I truly understand one must move with the times and not lag behind in the world of music, hence their recent other Best Of called Adapt or Die, but they abandoned a lot of fans when they sold out to the techno/electronica audience. I miss their early days and wish they would record just one more last album of the old stuff for their old fans- a sort of gift to those of us who were there in the beginning.",0
"King Arthur is the KING of soundtracks!!!!

I *LOVE* this soundtrack as much as the film which I reccomend just as highly. The music beautifully represents galloping horses, and the battle music is powerful and exhilerating!

"Huge plot holes

I usually love Miller's books but found this one to be poorly written. The plot holes were gaping and the devices were not worthy of an author of Miller's caliber.

I have loved this album since it first came out. I was in 8th grade and had just moved back to Maryland from North-West D.C. Just a friend is a classic, but the best song on the album is: ""A Thing Named Kim"". The story is just too funny and could possibly happen to anyone.",1
"0 STARS: And I thought the first one was bad!!!

The movie ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" is terrible. I could not wait for this movie to end. The movie is not scary...the creature looks like a flying piece of feces and the acting is horrible. There are no redeeming qualities for this movie. This creature is the biggest wuss I have ever laid eyes upon.All I would need to do to kill this wuss of a creature is to grab my 12 gauge shotgun and some dove shot and sit in a cornfield with some beers and just have a good ole time. I cannnot believe that anyone takes this movie seriously. However, the movie is very unintentionally funny though because it is so unbelievably pathetic. Some people actually call ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" a horror movie...I just call it rubbish.",0

"`simple to use

We bought this gate for our 9 month old crawling baby for use at the bottom of stairs. It works extremely well for areas with uneven surfaces. We use it on a wall that has one side with trim and it works well because you can adjust each side to different lengths if needed.The only negative is that the adjustment requires you turn the knobs and this can take some time if you have a wide opening or if you need to move the gate a lot. I would suggest getting two gates rather than trying to move one if you do so often.",1
"An obscure CD from a better-than-average 1990s R&B singer.

Bruce Saunders' ""Touch You There"" CD deserved a better fate. While by no means an heir to the Soul greats of the 1960s and '70s, Bruce Saunders comes across as a far more mature and sophisticated singer than most of his New Jack Swing contemporaries. The romantic ballads and mid-tempo jams are surprisingly enjoyable (especially for someone like myself who DOES NOT like most post-1988 R&B!) but the uptempo dance tracks are faceless. When I listen to this CD, I can't help but wonder if poor promotion and mundane material doomed Bruce Saunders' career.",1
"A book of bored people..

This book was unforgettable to me also. I read it back in the 70's when I was very much interested in having a different life than my parents(IBM!). And what is unforgettable is that this book, although highly recommended, was very boring and disappointing. At one point the characters are looking at their extensive book collection, remembering that it was supposed to have made all the difference, as though the books would jump off the shelf and live their lifes for them. It's just sad and depressing and mad me feel bad about books for quite some time since I had been looking for change in this bland tome.",0

"It does leak

The first thing I did with this flask was fill it with water, tighten the cap snugly, and shake it towards my hand. Water came out. That's the kind of flask you're looking at here. It's not even the threading on the cap, either; it leaks where the neck meets the body. When I squeeze the flask a little, water bubbles out from there. The box it came in was undamaged, so the leak must have been due to plain old shoddy manufacturing. That's what I get for trying to be too cheap. I'll be recycling this one and spending a bit more on the next one.Update: I bought a replacement flask on eBay for about $10 that appears to be identical to this one. This new one, though, doesn't leak, which leads me to believe that these particular flasks are probably just hit or miss and you'll either get a great deal or a worthless paperweight.",0
"Lack of Citation

I found that this book is a practical book as it gives lot of do's and don't. However, this book should incorporate proper citation method. For instance, on page 6, ""Research has shown... audience may not return to a medium one they have abandoned it for another."" I would like to know who says this and form where it is obtained.On page 241, the writers quote Judith Lewis book on Trauma and Recovery. I just wondering form what page was it extracted. Nevertheless, this book complements many other books as it gives media practitioner stand point. Certainly they need ""polishing"" as written on page 16.",0

According to Logitech these parts are not available for replacement regardless of wether or not you wish to pay for them. This is a terrible example of customer service. Logitech has enough brand recognition apparently that it does not need new customers. I personally will never buy another Logitech product.

"Is ""Monkey Island"" the best song ever?

No, ""Monkey Island"" is not the best song ever made...but it's really good, surprisingly good at 9 minutes-plus and this CD is worth buying just for this song.I'm surprised other reviewers don't mention ""You're the only one."" It got airplay back in the 70's but I haven't seen it (nor the title track) on any Geils 'greatest hits' collections so I guess I'm alone in my preferences. Oh well.Overall, my impression is that Geils fans prefer the rambunctious and rowdy. If that's you, this may not be the album for you. ""Wreckage"" is another great song: all my favorites here are moody and subdued. The instruments do not overwhelm the songs, the musicianship is playful and skillful. Comparison to the Rolling Stones (if useful at all?) is not apt for this album -- it trends more toward The Doors ('Strange Days' variety). It's not just frenetic energy, there's some real heart in ""Monkey Island.""",1

"Horrid under the fingers and worse for the ear

Of course each instrument has its own requirements but I have tried these strings on 3 fine instruments for professional use.

It's a light, quick read that tells the story from the perspectives of Dodi Fayed's bodyguard, his family, his attorneys, and the surgeon who rebuilt his face.

There's almost nothing worth watching in this movie. For one thing, who would let Kevin Costner as lead actor? I don't want to offend the man, but his acting is getting a little weaker as each film of his rolls by. The Postman is easily more dull than his last post-apocalyptic ""epic"" Waterworld, though not quite as stupid. Still, The Postman is bland, and too arrogant and cheesy to be entertaining.

As a lifelong resident of Iowa, I was excited at the prospect of watching this tape and I recognized most of the names of the towns and some of the scenes.

The music track is sedate to the point of being acceptable background music in an elevator and there are significant gaps in the narration. Furthermore, some of the images are maintained longer than is really necessary. I found it so boring that I had to watch it in segment approximately 20 minutes in length.

Most of the time you are running around in the snow or some featureless hallway with not much clue of what you are doing.Save points are spaced ridiculously, some are too close together, some too far apart.Trust system works....not at all. All your companions ""turn"" so there's seriously no point to it. As for story and character developement...forget it!A special mention about the bosses in the game because they are stupid. Last boss is easiest of all and the second boss you can just run past to the next level.Badly designed in all areas, boring, and directionless, with characters you don't care one whit about. A total disappointment.",0

"This Cd Is Not Worth Your Money

I liked the 'chocolate coverd starfish' cause' of the beats. but what I didn't like about 'CCS' was that there was ton of cussing and terrible lyrics.On a scale from 1 to 10 'CCS' would get a 2 1/2. but this album..... Don't thik so, i'd give it a 0 if it had one. All this is is a remix, there's no new songs, your just listning to chocolate coverd starfish all over again.Thank God I don't have this album, hopefully you don't either.",0
"Good cd... better burned

After buying this cd, i found out the only place i could play was on my friends portabled player, so i returned it. This is because of the 'protection', which is bull since it basically says that they dont trust their customers. I normally dont download illegal mp3's, but i made an exception. The cd protection isnt perfect, so there are some copies on the net. I also made myself a protetion free cd... I highly reccomend it. Just think of it as a consolation gift for them wasting your time.",0
"Wonderful for my netherland dwarf!

The way I had set this up was into three floors, one shelf on the second floor and two shelves next to each other on the third floor.She loves digging and sleeping on the bottom and having a ""grass lounge"" on the third floor. She eats food on the second floor. It's like she has so many rooms to walk around in! She loves relaxing in it after running outside of her cage so much. :)",1
"Works like a charm

I used this product to dig several 2'6"" fence post holes, and it worked great. I tried using the clam shell diggers at first, and then gave these a try after making no progress.As other reviewers have mentioned rocks and roots will give you issues.It seems to work best if you get it started 2"" to 3"" deep with the clam shell diggers, and then you can pretty much drill straight down with this tool.I would highly recommend.",1
"Mind-numbingly boring

Chabon has a masterful command of the English language. Either that, or he has a masterful command of a thesaurus. I've never seen such unnecessary vocabulary used anywhere. It was excessive, confusing and at times, it looked like he only wrote these words to show off.Mr. Chabon - Tell a story. Tell it well. Stop writing.Unless you have a lot of time to flip the pages of this directionless and frustrating book, skip it. Read something more interesting and exciting. There's plenty out there.",0
"Wonderfully practical.

This is one of those computer books that you know after 30 seconds of reading, that it will change your career.

"Far Below Lonely Planet's Regular Standards

I lost count of the number of errors in this book. They printed the wrong dates for Carnaval Samba Parades, the prices are in USD rather than in local currency - all wrong by an average 30%, as well. Hotels and restaurants are listed that closed long before the January 2002 publication date, and it's obvious that they haven't been to Brasilia in years - citing it as `treeless` - which I`m sure it was twenty years ago, but not today.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend a better Brazil guide because I don't have any experience with any others, but I enjoyed ceremoniously burning this book when I left Brazil.The most disappointing is that other Lonely Planet Guidebooks (I have used 5 other ones) far exceed the standards that this one set.",0

"Who is giving these positive reviews?

This movie is terrible! I can't believe it has so many positive reviews---considering the reviewers all either a)share the same last name as the teenager who wrote/directed/starred in this movie and 2)live in or around Los Angeles, CA....it seems like these are people Anne-Sophie knows who are inflating the positive ratings on purpose to sell this movie. This movie was written/directed/starred in by a 16 year old girl. In all ways this movie looks and feels like a bad teenage novella. The acting is terrible, the movie is boring, it is a low budget high school project. I have no idea who backed the funding for this movie, probably the girl's own family. If you are dying to see this movie I suggest you rent it first. It's a real snoozer...don't waste your $$.",0

Please do not waste your money on this book! It is such a joke. Unfortunately, the premise of poring through 50,000 names appealed to me. What the book's jacket didn't mention was that the names are all unbelievable and obviously made up. I can't even count how many times she makes up compound names (Joanielee or Stacielee or Phoebelee) to fill in space.Do yourself a favor and find a good baby name Web site instead.

"Fryer Works Excellent!!

Purchased this fryer just prior to use on Thanksgiving 2010. Shipping was fast, I think it took 3 days or so to get to me. All items came in the box as indicated. The fryer worked excellent. It took me about 45 min to fry a 12-15 pound turkey. The only bad thing I can say about this is that the design is such that a small breeze will cause you to loose a lot of heat creating a longer cook time. I fixed this by using two pieces of plywood to create a wind break. However, I would not call this a deal stopper by any means. I paid $81 for this kit and saw it in one of the warehouse clubs (BJ's) for $99. Overall, I would highly recommend this fryer. Why I didn't give it 5 stars? This fryer did not exceed my expectations. It did what it was supposed to do.",1

My review relates to this product as it's a sunrocket device. My advice is go with a different VOIP service. There's many out there !

"Exactly What The Factory Put In New

There are 2 parts that I always use factory-supplied rather than aftermarket... brake pads and oil filters. I had the choice of these pads, which are identical to what was installed new at the factory, or pads with a ceramic friction material. I have used ceramic pads at more expense in the past and was not happy with them. While ceramic pads can be quieter and longer lasting than the original material, they can cause more wear on the rotors and my experience has been that they fade badly when hot. These pads were installed on a 2007 Rendezvous (rear) and are just as effective and quiet as when the car was new. I can expect they will last 60-80,000 miles, maybe more. As-new is perfect as far as I'm concerned.",1
"I have questions

I have just started(eighth day)and have lost and gained and am now at the same weight I was when I started but I am not giving up. I am confused about the comp meals, though.

I am going to start with 1 comp meal a day to see if that will work. I would love to hear from someone with ideas on how to enhance my progress. I also walk 3 miles 3 or 4 times a week.

There are made in Indonesia or Bali mostly using timbers like Teak by drilling the log.

"Don't Buy!

Bought this router and tried to set it up. Couldn't get it to work after spending an hour on the phone with the Linksys support people. They finally said it was defective. Went back to the store to return this router, and bought another one (same model). Same story! Spent another hour on the phone with Linksys; this second router didn't work either. The Linksys support person said this router was also defective. Returned this second router -- total time spent: 4 hours including travel to and from the store twice. And still no router.Solution: went to a different store and bought a Netgear router. The Netgear router worked beautifully right out of the box. It took 5 minutes to set up. It's also much more classy looking than the Linksys router.Moral of the story: DON""T BUY this lousy Linksys router. As I look at the reviews posted here, it seems that more and more people have had trouble with the current Linksys routers. I'd recommend you check out the NETGEAR routers instead!",0

"Beautiful album from the masters of Pearl Jam

Firstly I loved the way the cover of the CD was designed and the pictures of the band in studio recording is absolutely novel and great fun. Like other reviewers I will also add to their voice my voice and state that this album is the missing link in the evolution of this great American band. It is very enjoyable to listen to the rock riffs and the small amount of grunge and funk in this album - a mixture that is used so well in many of their albums.Pearl Jam's popularity is not diminishing even after all this time. They have messages in all their songs and their lyrics are pure and true to heart. Their music transcends to fans' heart and souls for one reason, and because they are so real in delivery and execution.All the songs on this release are great. There is none lacking but my three favourites are; 'Lukin', 'Off He Goes' and 'Sometimes'.Well worth getting for old Pearl Jam fans. They will truly appreciate this CD.",1

"Read to learn the sailors' stories and for a sea adventure.

Steven Jackson does a great job of telling the stories of many of the sailors on both the Santa Fe and the Franklin. The variety and depth of stories told shows his care for the veterans involved. Interwoven amongst the personal histories is a fairly conventional history of the the war in the Pacific. As other reviewers note there are a number of historical errors, some more grating than others. A general reader will get a good overview of the history of war against the Japanese seen through the lens of the experiences of these two vessels and their crews. A more knowledgeable reader may be distracted. But it is a story worth reading, despite it's faults. One should read this book with a focus of hearing the sea stories and the drama of the tale. This is the story you would hear as told by a veteran, errors and all. For an accurate history or the Pacific war, there are other, better (and dryer) sources. But few more exciting.",1

I've been making patterns for 6 years, and I remember starting out totally confused about the whole moving darts issue. It took me an entire school semester to figure it out. This book is confused. It makes you design using store bought patterns (beginners stuff), then gives you vague directions that only a professional could understand. Don't waste you money.",0

This is actually a five-star book, one of Sagan's best, but this review is specifically geared towards the Kindle edition, which at this time includes none of the beautiful, essential photography from the original hardbound book. While the writing is still composed of Sagan's great and wise words, the book is but a shadow of itself without pictures, and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for omitting them. This is a digital edition folks - it can and should contain multiple forms of media where called for, and there is absolutely no excuse for not reproducing the photography and illustrations from the original work. Until they release an edition with pictures intact, I must give this a one-star review and steer potential buyers to the actual book, not the Kindle edition.",0

This may be a spoof but it's an affectionate and educated one, the songs are so authentic that if you're a fan of this kind of music you can't fail to enjoy this album but if you're not then you can just enjoy the light (well in comparison to say ""Big Bottom"" by Spinal Tap) parody that is present in the songs. In fact I'm sure that someone who did enjoy this music and didn't know that it was a spoof would love it's authenticity. Personal highlights are the rollocking title track and the hilariously authentic and atrocious spoken spanish interlude in Skeletons of Quinto (which was so cruelly denied in the movie).",1
